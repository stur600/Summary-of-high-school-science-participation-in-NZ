Drawing on data from over 900 female undergraduates in physics, we examine when these women became interested in physics careers and different sources of recognition (important for physics identity development) that may have affected their choices at certain time points. The results provide optimism since many of these female students, even those not previously intending science careers, began to intend physics careers in high school and recognition from high school physics teachers had a significant effect on predicting these intentions.}

,	abstract	= {The present article investigates explanations for gendered trends in Physics and Engineering access, reporting findings from a large-scale study funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council and drawing primarily on data from interviews with 132 15-16 year-old adolescents and their parents. Survey results in our study and elsewhere show strong gender disparities in anticipated pursuit of Physics after completion of compulsory education. In order to explore the constructions of gender and Physics underlying these trends, we focus on qualitative interview data, applying Foucaultian analysis of discourse to investigate gendered narratives underpinning adolescents' and their parents' articulations. This analysis reveals three key discourses at work on the topic of women's access to Physics: (a) equality of opportunity, (b) continued gender discrimination in and around Physics, and (c) Physics as quintessentially masculine. We additionally identify five distinct narratives supporting the discourse of physics as masculine. These various discourses and narratives are interrogated, and their implications explored. We conclude that it is only by disrupting prevalent constructions of the Physical sciences as a masculine and "hard" domain will we increase the presence of women in the sector. Working with young people to analyse and deconstruct the discursive assumptions made in relation to gender and Physics, as well as further work to increase accessibility and broaden representation in Physics, may be fruitful ways to challenge these longstanding associations between Physics and masculinity.

,	abstract	= {Bourdieu argues that fields of action produce a specific habitus in participants, and views this specific habitus as a mechanism through which the field is reproduced. Although Bourdieu acknowledges the habitus as gendered, he does not theorize gender as part of the mutually constitutive relationship between field and habitus. Using evidence from two cultural fields, the Toronto heavy metal and folk music scenes, I show that gender is central to the process through which field and habitus sustain each other. The metal field produces a “metalhead habitus” that privileges gender performances centered on individual dominance and status competition. In contrast, the “folkie habitus” encourages gender performances centered on caring, emotional relations with others, and community-building. These differently gendered habitus support different working conventions: music production occurs largely through volunteer-based nonprofit organizations in the folk field, and individual entrepreneurship in the metal field. The gendered habitus also supports different stylistic conventions: guitar virtuosity in the metal field, and participatory music-making in folk. Applying a gendered lens to the field–habitus relationship clarifies the mechanisms through which cultural fields shape individual action, and the mechanisms through which cultural fields are reproduced and maintained.}

Scientific capital is a well-known concept for measuring and assessing the accumulated recognition and the specific scientific power developed by Pierre Bourdieu. The scientific capital of a physics research institution manifests itself as a reputation, a high-profile name in the field of physics, symbols of academic recognition, and scientific status. Using citation statistics from the Web of Science Core Collection and sociological data of dedicated survey “The Monitoring of the Labor Market for Highly Qualified R\&D Personnel” we construct the social space of Russian physics institutions. The analysis reveals generalized grounds of social space of Russian physics institutions: principles of visibility and scientific capital. The study highlights internal differentiation of physics institutions on three groups (“major”, “high energy”, and “secondary” institutions). The social space of physics research institutions provides a map of field of physics in Russia. This research may be a useful starting point for developing a more comprehensive study of the field of physics.}

,	title	= {Teachers' Understanding and Operationalisation of 'Science Capital'}
,	abstract	= {Across the globe, governments, industry and educationalists are in agreement that more needs to be done to increase and broaden participation in post-16 science. Schools, as well as teachers, are seen as key in this effort. Previous research has found that engagement with science, inclination to study science and understanding of the value of science strongly relates to a student's science capital. This paper reports on findings from the pilot year of a one-year professional development (PD) programme designed to work with secondary-school teachers to build students' science capital. The PD programme introduced teachers to the nature and importance of science capital and thereafter supported them to develop ways of implementing science capital-building pedagogy in their practice. The data comprise interviews with the participating teachers (n = 10), observations of classroom practices and analyses of the teachers' accounts of their practice. Our findings suggest that teachers found the concept of science capital to be compelling and to resonate with their own intuitive understandings and experiences. However, the ways in which the concept was operationalised in terms of the implementation of pedagogical practices varied. The difficulties inherent in the operationalisation are examined and recommendations for future work with teachers around the concept of science capital are developed.}

,	title	= {The cultural authority of science: public trust and acceptance of organized science.}
,	abstract	= {Using the National Science Foundation's 2006 Science Indicators Survey, this study explores three distinct explanations of public attitudes. First, the knowledge-attitudes model refers to a well tested relationship between public knowledge of science and more favorable attitudes toward science. Second, the alienation model hypothesizes that public disassociation with science is a symptom of a general disenchantment with late modernity, mainly, the limitations associated with codified expertise, rational bureaucracy, and institutional authority. A third approach emphasizes the cultural meaning of science: how various public beliefs about "what science is" relate to acceptance or reservations about science. The Science Indicators Survey shows that US adults view science (what it is or should be) in three distinct ways: (1) in terms of having a systematic method, (2) in terms of social location (i.e., takes place in a university or a laboratory), and (3) in terms of knowledge that should accord with commonsense and tradition. The findings in this study indicate that the knowledge-attitudes, alienation, and cultural meanings models are all valuable for understanding the cultural authority of science. However, the strength of these explanations depends on the type of attitude analyzed.}

,	title	= {Mathematics capital in the educational field: Bourdieu and beyond}
,	abstract	= {ABSTRACT Mathematics education needs a better appreciation of the dominant power structures in the educational field: Bourdieu’s theory of capital provides a good starting point. We argue from Bourdieu’s perspective that school mathematics provides capital that is finely tuned to generationally reproduce the social structures that serve to keep the powerful in power, while ensuring that less powerful groups are led to accept their own failure in mathematics. Bourdieu’s perspective thereby highlights theoretical inadequacies in much mathematics education research, insofar as it presumes a consensus about a ‘what works agenda’ for improving achievement for all. Drawing on one case where we manufactured awkward facts, we illustrate a Bourdieusian interpretation of mathematics capital as reproductive, and the crucial role of its cultural arbitrary. We then criticise the Bourdieusian concept of ‘mathematical capital’ as the value of mathematical competence in practice and propose to extend his tools to include the contradictory ‘use’ and ‘exchange’ values of mathematics instead: we will show how this conceptualisation goes ‘beyond Bourdieu’ and helps explain how teaching-learning might (ideally) produce ‘cultural use value’ in mathematical competence, while still recognising the contradictions teachers and learners face. Finally, we suggest how critical education research generally can benefit from this theoretical framework: (1) in exposing the interest of the dominant classes; but also (2) in researching critical pedagogic alternatives that challenge orthodoxy in educational policy and practice both in mathematics education and more generally.}

,	title	= {Re-thinking science capital: The role of 'capital' and 'identity' in mediating students' engagement with mathematically demanding programmes at university}
,	abstract	= {A wide body of literature has highlighted how high achievement in mathematics in secondary school does not necessarily motivate students to both choose and succeed on mathematically demanding programmes at post-compulsory level. The recent Enterprising Science project (Archer et al. (2015, J Res. Sci. Teach., 52, 922-948)) and before that, the ASPIRES project (Archer et al. (2013, London: Kings College)), have both highlighted that access to science capital is perhaps more important than prior achievement in shaping students' aspirations and their future trajectories in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. In this article, we critically analyse the notion of science capital and its role in mediating students' choice of and experience of studying mathematically demanding degree programmes at university. Drawing on data from the Trans Maths project, we present two cases-Stacey and Elton-who are both enrolled on the same 'Mathematics for Physics' course at university. We show that although both discuss access to science capital in narrating their choice of degree, they do so in different ways and this invariably interplays with different forms of identification with 'Mathematics for Physics'. We conclude that there is a need to re-conceptualize science capital so that the dialectic relationship between its exchange and use value is theorized more fully. Whilst some students may access science capital as a means to accumulate capital (e.g. qualifications) for its own sake (exchange value), others appear to recognize the 'use value' of science learning and knowledge and this produces different forms of engagement with science (and mathematics). We therefore argue that authoring oneself in the name of a STEM identity is crucial in mediating how one perceives science capital. Finally, we argue that mathematics should be a central part of this framework since it significantly contributes to the exchange value of science as a form of capital (especially Physics), but it also offers use value in scientific labour (e.g. in modelling scientific problems). © The Author 2016.}

,	abstract	= {Currently, science in England is distinctive at General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in comparison to most other subjects, in that there is a notable stratification of award routes. The most prestigious of these, 'Triple Science' (the route for entry for three separate science GCSEs), is championed by English government and industry, but has received scant critical academic attention to date. Drawing on data collected via a national survey of over 13,000 Year 11 students aged 15/16 years and in-depth longitudinal interviews conducted with 70 students from this cohort (from age 10 to 16), we discuss how most students have little if any choice over which science 'option' they take at GCSE. Drawing on Bourdieu's concept of pedagogic action, we unpick how students are 'channelled' into making the 'right' choices and come to accept their allocation as legitimate. We explore how selective practices around Triple Science create and perpetuate social inequalities, producing different patterns of student identity, aspiration and attainment. In particular, we discuss the identification of Triple Science as 'for the clever' and problematise its relationship with the science 'pipeline' . We conclude by suggesting potentially more equitable ways forward for science education, reflecting on implications for post-16 participation.}

,	title	= {Who Aspires to a Science Career? A comparison of survey responses from primary and secondary school students}
,	abstract	= {There is broad international agreement about the importance of increasing participation in science once it is no longer compulsory in school, particularly among groups who have been historically underrepresented in science. Previous research reflects that despite broadly positive attitudes to science in and outside of school, there is limited translation of these attitudes into later aspirations and participation in science. The ASPIRES project, a five-year longitudinal study, has sought to understand students’ science and career aspirations between the ages of 10 and 14 and to identify factors that contribute to, or hinder, the development of aspirations in science. Utilising data from two cross-sectional surveys conducted with students in their last year of primary school (9300 students) and in their third year of secondary school (4,600 students), we explore who is most likely to hold science aspirations and what factors seem to be connected to those aspirations at both time points. Descriptive, multivariate and multilevel modelling analyses of the data reflect consistency in who holds science aspirations, as well as highlighting that the factors connected to these aspirations—attitudes to school science and parental attitudes—are similar at both times. However, for many students, positive attitudes to school science and positive parental attitudes to science are not translating into children wanting a career in science. We suggest that differences in ‘science capital’ may help explain this persistent gap.}

,	title	= {Is science for us? Black students' and parents' views of science and science careers}
,	abstract	= {ABSTRACT There are widespread policy concerns to improve (widen and increase) science, technology, engineering, and mathematics participation, which remains stratified by ethnicity, gender, and social class. Despite being interested in and highly valuing science, Black students tend to express limited aspirations to careers in science and remain underrepresented in post-16 science courses and careers, a pattern which is not solely explained by attainment. This paper draws on survey data from nationally representative student cohorts and longitudinal interview data collected over 4 years from 10 Black African/Caribbean students and their parents, who were tracked from age 10-14 (Y6-Y9), as part of a larger study on children's science and career aspirations. The paper uses an intersectional analysis of the qualitative data to examine why science careers are less 'thinkable' for Black students. A case study is also presented of two young Black women who 'bucked the trend' and aspired to science careers. The paper concludes with implications for science education policy and practice.

,	title	= {Science-related Aspirations Across the Primary–Secondary Divide: Evidence from two surveys in England}
,	abstract	= {Students' engagement with science and the numbers pursuing further study of science continue to be a concern among policy-makers, particularly in Western countries. Previous research reflects that most children have positive attitudes to science at age 10 but that, by age 14, attitudes towards and interest in further pursuit of science have declined. The Science Aspirations and Career Choice (ASPIRES) project, a 5-year longitudinal study, seeks to trace and track changes in students' interest in science and in scientific careers over the key period of ages 10–14. Building on an initial survey (consisting primarily of Likert-type items) of over 9,000 children in their last year of primary school, we explore shifts in attitudes and aspirations in science as reflected in a second survey of students from this cohort (over 5,600 students), completed when children were in their second year of secondary school (ages 12–13). Survey findings are supplemented by longitudinal interview data from 85 children. Contrary to previous research, descriptive, multivariate and multi-level modelling (MLM) analyses of the data indicate that the majority of our sample enjoy school science in secondary school and hold positive views of scientists. However, as with the primary school data, these positive attitudes also continue not to translate into an interest in ‘being’ a scientist. Attention is drawn to the importance of families and student experiences of school science in helping to explain this gap.}

,	abstract	= {Students’ interest in studying science and their aspirations to pursue science-related careers is a topic of global concern. In this paper, a set of data gathered for the initial phase of the 5-year study of Science Aspirations and Careers: Age 10–14 (the ASPIRES project) is presented. In the initial phase of this project, a questionnaire exploring students’ aspirations was developed, validated and trialled with nearly 300 primary school students. Principal component analyses and Cronbach’s alpha revealed that the questionnaire was comprised of a number of unidimensional components and that reliability was acceptable. Further multivariate analyses indicated that students’ aspirations in science were most strongly predicted by parental attitudes to science, attitudes towards school science, self-concept in science, images of scientists and engagement in science-related activities outside of school. Moreover, ‘Asian’ students appeared to exhibit a highly positive set of attitudes towards science and aspirations in science, particularly when compared with White students. Reasons for this observed difference are also explored.}

,	abstract	= {The relative lack of students studying post-compulsory STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects is a key policy concern. A particular issue is the disparities in uptake by students’ family background, gender and ethnicity. It remains unclear whether the relationship between student characteristics and choice can be explained by academic disparities, and whether students’ background, gender and ethnicity interact in determining university subject choices, rather than simply having additive effects. I use data from more than 4000 students in England from ‘Next Steps’ (previously the LSYPE) and logistic regression methods to explore the interacting rela- tionships between student characteristics and subject choice. There are four main findings of this study. Firstly, disparities by students’ ethnicity are shown to increase when controlling for prior attainment. Secondly, family background indicators are differentially related to uptake for male and female students, with parents’ social class and education larger predictors of choice than financial resources. Thirdly, gender, ethnicity and family background interact in determining choices. Partic- ularly, as socio-economic position increases, young women are more likely to choose STEM over other high-return subjects. Finally, associations between student characteristics and subject choices, including interactions, largely persisted when accounting for A-level choices. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.}

,	title	= {Masculine Domination}
,	abstract	= {Masculine domination is so anchored in our social practices and our unconscious that we hardly perceive it; it is so much in line with our expectations that we find it difficult to call into question. Pierre Bourdieu’s analysis of Kabyle society provides instruments to help us understand the most concealed aspects of the relations between the sexes in our own societies, and to break the bonds of deceptive familiarity that tie us to our own tradition. Bourdieu analyzes masculine domination as a prime example of symbolic violence—the kind of gentle, invisible, pervasive violence exercised through the everyday practices of social life. To understand this form of domination we must also analyze the social mechanisms and institutions—family, school, church, and state—that transform history into nature and eternalize the arbitrary. Only in this way can we open up the possibilities for a kind of political action that can put history in motion again by neutralizing the mechanisms that have naturalized and dehistoricized the relations between the sexes. This new book by Pierre Bourdieu—which has been a bestseller in France—will be essential reading for anyone concerned with questions of gender and sexuality and with the structures that shape our social, political, and personal lives.}

,	title	= {Practical Reason: On the Theory of Action}
,	abstract	= {Do social classes really exist? Is disinterested action really possible? What do the family, the church, and the intellectual world have in common? Can morality be founded on hypocrisy? What is the "subject" of action? In this new volume, one of France's foremost social thinkers of our time responds to these major questions and to others, thus tracing the outlines of a work that could be called "Pierre Bourdieu by himself." In these texts, the author tries to go to the essential, that is, the most elementary and fundamental, questions. He thereby explains the philosophical principles that have led to his social science research and the idea of the human that guides his choices there. With the lucidity allowed by retrospect, Bourdieu brings out the fundamental theories of his greatest books, notably Outline of a Theory of Practice and The Logic of Practice (Stanford, 1990), and, with an eye to the future, presents the first results of his most recent work on the state, the anthropological moorings of the economy, and male domination. Bourdieu's theory is both a philosophy of science dedicated to revealing the objective relations that shape and underpin social life, and a philosophy of action that takes account of agents' dispositions as well as the structured situations in which they act. This philosophy of action is condensed in a small number of key concepts—habitus, field, capital—and it is defined by the two-way relationship between the objective structures of social fields and the incorporated structures of the habitus. All in all, this book should be an indispensable introduction to Bourdieu's work, not only to students and scholars in sociology, anthropology, political science, and philosophy, but throughout the social sciences and humanities generally.}

,	abstract	= {Researchers and policy makers often use the metaphor of an ever-narrowing pipeline to describe the trajectory to a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) degree or career. This study interrogates the appropriateness of the STEM pipeline as the dominant frame for understanding and making policies related to STEM career trajectories. Our review of pertinent literature and independent analysis of data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 finds that the trajectory implied by the pipeline metaphor fails to describe the experience for nearly half of those who go on to become scientists or engineers, masks meaningful differences in trajectories by subfield, and informs policies that do little to diversify or increase the size of the STEM workforce. We suggest a pathway metaphor to better illuminate the multiple trajectories toward STEM degrees and careers and present four composite trajectories as useful categorizations of the individual paths taken by STEM graduates and career entrants. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

,	abstract	= {Previous research has consistently demonstrated the importance of parents’ expectations and adolescents’ expectations on adolescents’ academic achievement. Less is known, however, about the reciprocal relationships among these constructs. To address this issue, we analyzed two waves of data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) using longitudinal cross-lagged path models. The sample consisted of 14,376 students (51.1% females; 6.5% Asian, 11.1% Hispanic, 9.2% African American, and 73.2% White). Results indicated that there was a reciprocal relationship between parents’ expectations and adolescents’ expectations (i.e., they had mutual influence on each other). Moreover, there was a reciprocal relationship between expectations (both parents’ and adolescents’) and adolescents’ academic achievement. Multiple-group analyses of gender and ethnicity revealed that the effects of parents’ expectations on students’ expectations were stronger among males than among females. With respect to ethnic differences, the effects of adolescents’ expectations were weakest on parents’ expectations among African Americans as compared to the other ethnic groups (i.e., Asian, Hispanic and White). Implications of these findings are discussed.}

,	abstract	= {In 2004, the pattern in academic pathways for high school students in the USA showed that students were completing more demanding mathematics courses. Despite the upward pattern in advanced-level mathematics course-taking, disparities among racial/ethnic groups persisted between 1982 and 2004. Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS: 2002; Ingels et al., 2007), the current study sought to advance understanding of gender and ethnic differences in advanced mathematics course-taking. Furthermore, this study examined how the differences are related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pathways in college. Results showed that the relationships between exploratory factors (both individual- and school-level factors) and advanced mathematics course-taking and STEM choices differed across ethnicity and gender. This highlights the need for further research that disaggregates data by both ethnicity and gender.

Two kinds of employment policies were examined: education-first programs with an emphasis on adult education and job training; and work-first programs with an emphasis on immediate employment. With data from two- and five-year follow-ups in four experimental demonstrations in Grand Rapids, Michigan (N = 591) and Riverside County, California (N = 629), there was evidence of small positive effects of the Grand Rapids and Riverside education-first programs on African American and Latino children's school readiness and math scores. An opposite pattern of effects emerged among Caucasian children. In one of the two sites, we found that Latino parents' higher levels of goals for pursuing their own education appeared to explain why their children benefited to a greater degree from the program than their Caucasian counterparts.}

,	abstract	= {Objective: This study analyzes how ethnicity, gender, and non-traditional student characteristics relate to differential online versus face-to-face outcomes in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses at community colleges. Method: This study used a sample of 3,600 students in online and face-to-face courses matched by course, instructor, and semester from a large urban community college in the Northeast. Outcomes were measured using rates of successful course completion (with a "C-" or higher). Multilevel logistic regression and propensity score matching were utilized to control for unobserved heterogeneity between courses and for differences in student characteristics. Results: With respect to successful course completion, older students did significantly better online, and women did significantly worse (although no worse than men) online, than would be expected based on their outcomes in comparable face-to-face courses. There was no significant interaction between the online medium and ethnicity, suggesting that though Black and Hispanic students may do worse on average in STEM courses than their White and Asian peers both online and face-toface, this gap was not increased by the online environment. Contributions: These findings suggest that both women and younger students in STEM courses may need extra support in the online environment. Future research is needed (a) to explore whether factors such as stereotype threat or child care responsibilities affect the outcomes of women in online STEM courses, and (b) to determine which characteristics (e.g., motivation, self-directed learning skills) of older students may make them particularly well suited to the online environment.

The aim of the article is to understand the role of decision-making in the emergence of educational trajectories. Based on the analysis of qualitative interviews with students from schools in disadvantaged areas, patterns of educational trajectories are discerned with regard to the ruptures they involve, the destinations they take and the degree of choice young people have. The in-depth analysis of exemplary cases, however, reveals that even within similar patterns of trajectories decision-making processes occur in different ways. Therefore, constellations of decision-making are elaborated which cross-cut the patterns of educational trajectories.

In this article, participants' responses to a Dutch gender awareness-raising project in medical education are discussed. Eighteen semi-structured interviews were held with education directors and change agents. Resistance towards and obstacles for gender mainstreaming in medical education were implicit in four themes: (1) biomedical knowledge was perceived to be gender neutral, to which knowledge about women could be added to the body of knowledge either with or without framing them as gender issues; (2) the relevance of gender was unofficially denied by downplaying it, particularly in comparison with culture/ethnicity; (3) medical education's social accountability was hardly mentioned and gender inequalities in health were framed as feminist political issues and not medical issues; and (4) we were urged to communicate carefully to increase acceptance and avoid overt resistance which situated gender inequalities outside the medical domain. Recommendations to change educational material were widely discussed; but specific features of gender were easily lost. This was especially true for power differences between men and women. Nevertheless, dominant systems of thought were challenged.}

Results revealed that participants of all ethnicities perceived strong institutional and peer supports in this diverse leaming environment. Additionally, differences in participants' perceived harriers for achieving engineering educational and career plans were found hased on ethnicity and parental level of education.}

The physical, intellectual, and emotional aspects of the environment must be considered. The physical characteristics of the room impact those who work within. Some of the characteristics are set and must be incorporated into the educator’s plans. Other characteristics (such as furniture arrangement, displays, and accessories) can be changed and are at the discretion of the educator. The intellectual environment of the classroom includes the standards, expectations, objectives, learning strategies, and assessment that are expressed directly through the written curriculum and covertly through the hidden curriculum. Individual differences among students and teachers need to be recognized and addressed, including learning styles, abilities, interests, and patterns of intelligences (Gardner, 1999). The emotional environment of the classroom is comprised of feelings of safety, support, and respect. Management, discipline, and motivation are important aspects of the emotional environment. The cultural impact is also important to recognize. This includes diversity in social class, race, ethnicity, and gender (Woolfolk, 1998)}

Perry posits that intellectual development proceeds from a basic dualism through nine stages (“positions”) and culminates with a sense of personal identify and commitment. Perry suggests that the college years act as the agent of intellectual development, but others have argued that Perry's scheme is not flexible enough to account for gender- and culture-based differences. This study uses a paper-and-pencil questionnaire to describe developmental characteristics of gifted high school students and examines between-group differences between gender and ethnic groups at the high school sophomore and senior years. All groups showed significant improvement from sophomore to senior year. There were no differences by gender or ethnicity at the sophomore year, but by senior year, significant developmental differences existed among ethnic groups.}

,	abstract	= {Objective: To examine demographic differences in frequency of use of technologies and interest in receiving nutrition information via technology by low-income parents and caregivers. Design: Descriptive, cross-sectional study. Setting: Head Start and state-funded child care programs. Participants: A total of 806 parents and caregivers from low-income families. Variables Measured: A 20-item survey assessed frequency of use and interest in technologies (dependent variables) and collected participant age and ethnicity (independent variables). Analysis: Multivariate ANOVA analysis investigated whether age, ethnicity, and their interactions were related to frequency of use and interest in technology types. Results: Daily rates of usage for Internet, text messaging, and cell phone use were over 60%. However, Twitter and blogs were accessed daily by < 13% of respondents. The omnibus 2-way interaction of ethnicity and age was nonsignificant. However, main effects for ethnicity (Wilks' ?? = .85; F = 3.13; P< .001) and age (Wilks' ?? = .89; F = 2.29; P < .001) were observed. Conclusions and Implications: Facebook, e-mail, texting, and smartphone applications may be innovative modalities to engage with low-income parents and caregivers aged ??? 45. However, some strategies may be ineffective for reaching Hispanic families as they reported less use of the Internet, Facebook, and e-mail as well as less interest in e-mail.}

,	abstract	= {Background and purpose : This study details the use of a conceptual framework to analyze prospective teachers’ images of scientists to reveal their context-specific conceptions of scientists. The conceptual framework consists of context-specific conceptions related to positive, stereotypical and negative images of scientists as detailed in the literature on the images, role and work of scientists. Sample, design and method : One hundred and ninety-six drawings of scientists, generated by prospective teachers, were analyzed using the Draw-A-Scientist-Test Checklist (DAST-C), a binary linear regression and the conceptual framework. Results : The results of the binary linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant difference for two DAST-C elements: ethnicity differences with regard to drawing a scientist who was Caucasian and gender differences for indications of danger. Analysis using the conceptual framework helped to categorize the same drawings into positive, stereotypical, negative and composite images of a scientist. Conclusions : The conceptual framework revealed that drawings were focused on the physical appearance of the scientist, and to a lesser extent on the equipment, location and science-related practices that provided the context of a scientist’s role and work. Implications for teacher educators include the need to understand that there is a need to provide tools, like the conceptual framework used in this study, to help prospective teachers to confront and engage with their multidimensional perspectives of scientists in light of the current trends on perceiving and valuing scientists. In addition, teacher educators need to use the conceptual framework, which yields qualitative perspectives about drawings, together with the DAST-C, which yields quantitative measure for drawings, to help prospective teachers to gain a holistic outlook on their drawings of scientists.}

,	abstract	= {There are long-standing achievement gaps in England associated with socio-economic status (SES), ethnicity and gender, but relatively little research has evaluated interactions between these variables or explored school effects on such gaps. This paper analyses the national test results at age 7 and age 11 of 2,836 pupils attending 68 mainstream primary schools in an ethnically diverse inner London borough. The groups with the lowest educational achievement and poorest progress were both Black Caribbean and White British low SES pupils. White British middle and high SES pupils made substantially more progress than White British low SES pupils, significantly increasing the SES gap over time. However low and high SES Black pupils made equally poor progress age 7–11. School effects on pupil progress were large, but there was no evidence of differential school effectiveness in relation to SES, ethnicity or gender. Low SES pupils in the more effective schools performed significantly better than high SES pupils in the less effective schools, but all pupils (both low and high SES) benefit from attending the more effective schools and so these schools do not eliminate the SES gap. The limits to change that may be achieved by schools alone are discussed.}

,	abstract	= {This paper contributes to the empirical evidence on participation and attainment in higher education by reviewing the patterns of entry and success of undergraduate students. It examines the characteristics of entrants to different subjects and considers the role that subject studied plays in determining the likelihood of graduating with a ‘good’ degree. The data used were drawn from the administrative records of over 38,000 UK-domiciled undergraduate students from one ‘elite’ British university. Despite considerable between-subject variation in degree outcomes, multivariate analysis of the relationship between students’ social and academic characteristics and achievement at university revealed that once social background and prior attainment had been controlled for, the subject students studied added little explanatory power to models predicting final degree classifications. Differences in degree outcome were most strongly related to attainment on entry to higher education, sex and ethnicity. In contrast with attainment during the earlier phases of education, the relationship with occupational class was relatively weak. Disparities between the proportion of higher level classifications awarded in different subjects can be largely explained by the background characteristics of the students who choose (and are accepted) to study on these degrees. This finding has particular implications for policies aimed at increasing both the number and quality of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) graduates in what is often argued to be a ‘shortage’ or ‘priority’ area.}

This descriptive study examined the differences in activity participation by family resources and markers of cultural orientation for the four largest Latino ethnic groups in the U.S. Findings were based on secondary data analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N¼11,689 Latino youth). Family resources were not strong predictors of partici- pation, but the markers of cultural orientation did predict activity participation. Surprisingly, foreign-born youth had higher participation than native-born youth. The proportion of their friendship network that was non-Hispanic friends positively predicted activity participation, whereas the proportion of co-ethnic and foreign-born Hispanic friends negatively predicted activity participation. Findings from this investigation highlight that there were few differences in participation by Latino ethnic group affiliation but great variability within each Latino ethnic group.}

Results showed differences in persistence by academic field as well as by gender, parental income, and first-generation college student status with the largest variation by ethnicity. Further examination of STEM major persistence showed that high school performance in math and science, taking advanced placement exams in STEM, articulating positive science self-efficacy beliefs, and professing a goal of obtaining a doctorate were also related to persistence in varied ways across STEM majors.}

This paper focuses upon comparing the quantitative patterns in Western (US Caucasian and African-American) and non-Western (Taiwanese) students' views of NOS (VNOS) by adopting a survey instrument. This analysis combined with qualitative data begin to uncover details of potential cultural differences in patterns specifically in the US educational context by comparing Caucasian and African-American student responses to a question from a commonly used assessment of VNOS. Results show different patterns of views along the four dimensions of NOS (social negotiation, invented/creative NOS, cultural impacts, and changing/tentative feature of science) according to student major, student gender, and student ethnicity. These differences and similarities have the potential to impact undergraduate education and underrepresentation of cultural minorities in science careers and call for further research into NOS views in the context of diverse student groups.}

,	abstract	= {More than 3 million students study outside their home country, primarily at a Western university. A common belief among educators is that international students are insufficiently adjusted to higher education in their host country, both academically and socially. Furthermore, several groups of international students experience considerable amounts of stress while adapting to the culture of the host-institute. Several researchers argue that studies on adaptation of international students should widen its focus to the underlying mechanisms that leads towards this "misalignment". In a cross-institutional comparison among 958 students at five business schools in the Netherlands, differences in academic performance between local and international students were identified by focussing on their levels of academic and social integration. Students' academic integration was measured with the Students' Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ), while students' social integration was measured with a newly developed and validated questionnaire. The results indicate that the degree of academic success of international students is multi-faceted. International students with a (mixed) western ethnic background perform well on both academic and social integration, and also attained higher study-performance in comparison to domestic students. In contrast, international students with a non-Western background are less integrated compared to other international students. Nevertheless, they have a similar study-performance. Finally, academic adjustment is the main predictor of study-performance for Dutch, Western and Mixed-Western students. Social adjustment was negatively related to study-performance. The lack of fit for predicting long-term study success of non-Western students indicates that their academic and social integration processes are more complex and non-linear.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]}

We find that the importance of enjoyment, self-concept, and achievement in explaining disparities in science career aspirations relative to White males varies according to the female subgroup considered, such that no singular story applies to females across different racial/ethnic backgrounds. For math, White and Hispanic females remain approximately half as likely as White males to aspire to a math occupation regardless of all indicators we consider. Finally, Black and Hispanic adolescent boys have generally comparable aspirations toward future careers in science and math as their White male peers, despite notably large differences in achievement. We discuss implications of our results for future research on equity.}

In most studies, sample sizes have been relatively small and few studies have taken into account pre-existing student differences. Here data from over 6000 students at one university over six cohorts and a range of programmes are analysed. Consistent academic benefit from placement experience, regardless of ethnicity, gender, socio-economic background and subject is shown. However, the impact of demographic factors on both achievement and the probability of taking a placement suggests that future research should take these factors into account. The role of placements in promoting employability is contextualised as a secondary benefit to the primary goal of educating the mind in the Newman tradition. Possible causes of, and further research into, the improved academic performance identified are discussed. (Contains 1 note and 3 tables.)}

Multiple linear regressions predicted 54.9-87.5% of the variance in student from Biochem I grade and 53.8-76.1% of the variance in student from Biochem II grade. Overall, the student's cumulative GPA has the primary influence on their biochemistry grade in Biochem I for all models whereas either cumulative GPA or Biochem I performance has the primary influence on Biochem II grade. These factors were far more influential than any other predictors as their β values were larger (5-10 times larger depending on the model). However, the gender of the student was also statistically significant for Biochem I and more than half of our Biochem II models with female students always predicted lower than their equivalent male counterparts. Biochemistry majors were also found to perform better in Biochem I. Interestingly, grades earned in prerequisite courses such as introductory biology, chemistry, or organic chemistry and ethnicity provided no additional predictive ability about students' performance in biochemistry. Enrollment in an honors college or science residential college had little direct impact on performance in biochemistry.

Because admissions brochures often serve as a potential student's introduction to the campus, they are carefully crafted to provide a specific impression of the institution. This study examined one aspect of the marketing of colleges by examining the portrayal of racial and ethnic diversity. Through a content analysis of over 10,000 photographs from 165 four-year institutions in the US, the accuracy of the photographic portrayal of diversity in recruitment materials was assessed. Findings indicate that the majority of institutions provided images of diversity to prospective students in 2011 that were significantly different than the actual student body. Furthermore, diversity was typically symbolized by portraying African American students at higher rates rather than presenting a more representative student body. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor \& Francis.}

This study uses latent class analysis to describe underlying differences in ability be-liefs, task values and links these science-self-perceptions to interest in science. Findings suggest that there is a positive relationship between students' science self-perceptions and interest in science which is consistent with previous research (see for example, Aschbacher, Ing, \& Tsai, 2014). The relationship between self-perceptions and interest in science was similar regardless of gender or ethnicity. Despite study limitations, self-perceptions should be considered valuable because teachers have in-fluence on both learning activities and a students' sense of self as a science learner. These results underscore the importance of preparing teachers to foster student desire to learn more science in the future. In organizing the data using this particular methodology, information is provided in a potentially powerful way to target specific interventions or support.}

,	abstract	= {In this paper, we consider whether teachers' explicit and implicit prejudiced attitudes underlie the ethnic achievement gap. To date, most research on teacher expectation effects has relied on explicit expectation measures that are prone to social desirability biases. In contrast, we examine the effects of teachers' (a) explicit ethnicity-based expectations for academic achievement and (b) implicit prejudiced attitudes about academic achievement on students' actual academic success over time. A total of 38 teachers completed both a traditional teacher expectation measure and a modified Implicit Association Task designed to assess ethnic stereotypes associated with academic achievement and failure. A multi-level analytic framework showed that students in classrooms of teachers with high expectations performed better in reading at the end of the year and that these effects were found across all ethnic groups. In contrast, whereas students' mathematics achievement scores were largely unrelated to teachers' explicit expectations, teachers' implicit prejudiced attitudes predicted student performance. Specifically, students benefited most academically when their teachers' implicit biases favored the ethnic group to which the student belonged. Findings are discussed in relation to differences in the salience of teachers' expectations and implicit prejudiced attitude in the classroom, and the ethnic achievement gap.}

,	abstract	= {Little research has examined whether the effects of race or socioeconomic status (SES) on educational attitudes differ by gender, limiting knowledge of unique vulnerabilities occurring at the intersection of multiple social statuses. Using data from 182 sixth-graders, interactions between gender, race/ethnicity, and SES in predicting educational aspirations, persistence, views of science, and educational self-efficacy are examined. African American and Latino boys express more negative attitudes relative to (1) higher-SES boys, (2) White boys, and (3) girls of any race/ethnicity or level of SES. The intersection of multiple inequalities in education across the early life course is discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)}

,	abstract	= {Research has primarily concentrated on adults' implicit theories about high quality science education for all students. Little work has considered the students' perspective. This study investigated high school students' implicit theories about what helped them learn science. This study addressed (1) What characterizes high school students' implicit theories of what facilitates their learning of science?; (2) With respect to students' self-classifications as African American or European American and female or male, do differences exist in the students' implicit theories? Students in an urban high school located in south-eastern United States were surveyed in 2006 about their thoughts on what helps them learn science. To confirm or disconfirm any differences, data from two different samples were analyzed. Responses of 112 African American and 118 European American students and responses from 297 European American students comprised the data for sample one and two, respectively. Seven categories emerged from the deductive and inductive analyses of data: personal responsibility, learning arrangements, interest and knowledge, communication, student mastery, environmental responsiveness, and instructional strategies. Instructional strategies captured 82% and 80% of the data from sample one and two, respectively; consequently, this category was further subjected to Mann-Whitney statistical analysis at p < .05 to ascertain ethnic differences. Significant differences did not exist for ethnicity but differences between females and males in sample one and sample two emerged. African American and European American students' implicit theories about instructional strategies that facilitated their science learning did not significantly differ but female and male students' implicit theories about instructional strategies that helped them learn science significantly differed. Because students attend and respond to what they think and perceive to be important, addressing students' implicit theories may be one way to enhance science education reform.}

Results showed that for the sample of gifted students used in this study, regardless of age, males outperformed females on the math and science subtests with the most pronounced differences on the math subtests, whereas females outperformed males on the verbal subtests. All these differences between genders did not diminish over the 9-year period but were steady with small or negligible effect sizes. The ratios of males to females in specific score ranges on the off-level tests were also steady and consistent, favoring males at the highest end in math and science with the maximum ratio of 3:1 and females at the highest end in verbal areas with the maximum ratio of 2:1. Performance differences by ethnicity and annual household income levels were also found throughout the years. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]}

The present study examined whether legitimacy beliefs-beliefs that status differences between men and women in STEM fields are fair-put women at risk for experiencing social identity threat and poorer performance on a difficult logic test. Legitimacy beliefs served as a risk factor for both women from ethnic groups that are overrepresented in STEM (e.g., Asian Americans and European Americans) and from ethnic groups that are underrepresented in STEM (African Americans and Latina Americans), albeit under different conditions. Among women from overrepresented ethnic groups, legitimacy beliefs were negatively related to test performance when explicit cues to sexism were present. However, among women from underrepresented ethnic groups, legitimacy beliefs were negatively related to test performance when explicit cues to sexism were absent. The present research points to the need for inclusion of ethnic diversity in studies of women in STEM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)}

,	abstract	= {This article reports on the outcomes of an action research project on gender and science education carried out in two upper secondary schools in Sweden. The article focuses on how student voices draw on wider societal discourses when they talk about what it means to be natural science students at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The article is divided into four sections. The first briefly describes the Swedish secondary school system, and identifies discourses of schooling and natural science in Swedish society. The second section contextualises the schools where the action research took place, concentrating in particular on the student focus groups. It further describes the methods used, the identification of themes from the students’ discussion, and the analysis of student voices in the light of societal discourses. The third section explores and analyses the issues raised in the focus groups, and these are further discussed in the final section where new insights are provided, at an individual as well as a more general level. Overall, the article draws attention to the importance of student ‘voices’ and of the student perspective in discourses of science, gender and education.}

,	abstract	= {This contribution investigates the social distance of immigrants from Poland in four Western European cities – London, Birmingham, Berlin and Munich – particularly Polish immigrants’ distance towards members of ethnic, religious and sexual minorities in their various social roles. Presenting unique data from the first wave of a longitudinal qualitative study, we first discuss the differential levels of social distance that Polish immigrants place between themselves and members of minority groups in each city. We find that respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics impact their social distance, but their education and occupation may have less of an effect than their place of origin in Poland or current place of residence and work. Moreover, these factors work differentially across the four cities. After analysing social distance with respect to three dimensions of difference – ethnicity, religion and sexuality – we find several different social-distancing mechanisms. Ultimately, we argue that social science needs to consider regional and local contexts in which social attitudes towards minorities are acquired and exercised. Similarly, we need to reflect on the group’s presumed homogeneity and on the unifying visions of the ‘host society’ as a site of migrants’ incorporation.}

These findings were disputed in a re-analysis carried out for HEFCE which found that only Pakistani candidates were significantly less likely to receive offers (from both 'old' and 'new' universities). In this paper we return to the question of ethnic differences in university offer rates, examining UCAS admissions data for 2008. We use a cross-classified multi-level modelling approach to predict the probability that applications from candidates from different ethnic groups will receive an offer. Controlling for variables seeking to capture the academic quality of applications we find significant differences between offer rates for different ethnic groups. Significantly lower offer rates remained for the main ethnic groups when social characteristics were also taken into account in the model (social class background, gender and school type). However, offer rates for candidates from mixed ethnic groups were not significantly different from those for white British candidates. Our analysis did not find evidence of differences in offer rates from higher and lower status institutions for black and minority ethnic candidates relative to white British applicants.}

,	abstract	= {This research examines demographic, academic, attitudinal, and experiential data from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) for over 12,000 students at two universities to test a methodology for identifying variables showing significant differences between students intending to major in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) versus non-STEM subjects. The methodology utilizes basic statistical techniques to identify significant differences between STEM and non-STEM students within seven population subgroups based upon school attended, race/ethnicity, and gender. The value of individual variables is assessed by how consistently significant differences are found across the subgroups. The variables found to be most valuable in identifying STEM students reflect both quantitative and qualitative measures. Quantitative measures of academic ability such as SAT mathematics score, high school grade point average, and to a lesser extent SAT verbal score are all indicators. Qualitative measures including self-ratings of mathematical ability, computer skills, and academic ability are also good indicators.

,	title	= {#Rhodes Must Fall: A posthumanist orientation to decolonising higher education Institutions}
,	abstract	= {Critical posthumanism focuses on difference, rather than identity, and queers humanist philosophy that has its roots in western metaphysics, which has had a strong humanist articulation since Descartes. Humanism centres on the autonomous adult self as sole source of knowledge production, and instils binaries that marginalise, divide and dichotomise the \&apos;other\&apos; in age, race, ethnicity, ability and sexuality. Postcolonial theorising interrogates these power-producing binaries, but tends to retain the dominant western ontological binary between language and reality, thereby assuming that knowledge production is always mediated through the discursive and represented in human-made languages, keeping the material world at a distance. The key question is \&apos;What is left out, forgotten or ignored by using the discursive apparatus of the social sciences only?&apos;.
Using Karen Barad\&apos;s reading of quantum physics I propose a radically different and positive philosophical orientation towards decolonisation and a \&apos;post\&apos;colonial future through a juxtaposition of a humanist and a posthumanist analysis of a series of photos I \&apos;made\&apos; of the Cecil Rhodes\&apos;s statue before it was removed from the University of Cape Town\&apos;s campus. The question what it means to decolonise a university is not only epistemological, but also ontological and can remain radically open when we view meaning making as discursive and material, thereby doing justice to the agency of the nonhuman other.}

The question asked by this research, i.e. which factors at various educational levels influence science achievement in Korea and South Africa respectively, is addressed from the perspective of school effectiveness. Data from Korea included 5,300 learners from 151 schools, while approximately 9,000 learners from 265 schools were tested in South Africa. The background data were analysed in conjunction with the achievement data by means of factor, reliability, correlation and multilevel analysis. The multilevel analysis revealed that the strongest predictor of science achievement is attitudes towards science in both countries at learner level while, at classroom/ school level, the strongest predictors are learner background in Korea and safety in school in South Africa respectively. In addition, factors specifically significant in Korea included educational resources, out-of-school activities, high expectation, professional development, and school size, while South Africa showed factors such as ethnicity and SES-related factors, textbook use, teacher age, teacher qualification, STS-based teaching, physical resources, and class size.}

,	abstract	= {Chemistry courses remain a challenge for many undergraduate students. In particular, first-semester organic chemistry has been labeled as a gatekeeper with high attrition rates, especially among students of color. Our study examines a key factor related to conceptual understanding in science and predictive of course outcomes - knowledge structures. Previous research on knowledge structures has focused on differences between experts and novices. Given the increasing ethnic diversity of college classrooms and research indicating unique differences in certain higher order cognitive processes associated cultural practices and ethnicity, it is important to investigate whether similar patterns exist with respect to knowledge structures. Our study utilized concept maps to measure knowledge structures. Two separate analyses where performed to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students' organize their knowledge of organic chemistry content in structurally different ways. The first analysis utilized concept map proposition scoring to examine the influence of prior science achievement and ethnicity on knowledge structures. The second analysis examined holistic map structures to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students show qualitatively distinct structures overall. Results show significant mean differences on concept map proposition scores related to both prior science achievement and ethnic group membership. However, examination of holistic structures revealed that students' qualitative holistic structures did not vary by ethnic group membership. Taken together, our findings suggest that variation in students' knowledge structures are related to prior science achievement across ethnic groups, not qualitative differences in the ways ethnically diverse students' structure knowledge. Implications for teaching and learning in organic chemistry are discussed.}

,	title	= {Breaking it down: Engineering student STEM confidence at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender}
,	abstract	= {It is generally accepted that engineering requires a strong aptitude for mathe-matics and science; therefore, students' judgments regarding their competence in these areas as well as engineering likely influence their confidence in engineering. Little is known about how self-confidence in science, mathematics, and engineering courses (STEM confidence) varies at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender. To fill this gap, this study examined the STEM confidence of multiple groups in undergraduate engineering programs. Results indicated that although some underrepresented groups may have lower STEM confidence overall, this finding no longer applies to all groups after controlling for personal, environmental, and behavioral factors. Specifically, African-American and His-panic men report higher average STEM confidence than White men after controlling for these associated measures. In addition, White women continue to report lower average STEM confidence than White men after controlling for these measures, while other groups do not differ from White men. Further, many elements of student perception, including student views of professors, comparisons to peers, perceptions of the field as rewarding, and desirability of chosen major are positively associated with student STEM confidence. The changing patterns of significance for race/ethnicity and gender groups between the two models indicate that personal, environmental, and behavioral factors have different rela-tionships with STEM confidence levels for different groups. This study contributes an understanding that gender differences in STEM confidence are not indifferent to racial and ethnic context. Social-cognitive theory provides a valuable framework for studying student academic confidence and would improve future self-confidence research. Currently, the U.S. has a shortage of skilled domestic workers; and jobs requiring knowledge and skills in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) continue to grow (Jiang and Freeman 2011; Marra et al. 2012; May and Chubin 2003; Terrel 2007). In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that STEM occupations will increase by 22 % between 2004 and 2014 (Terrel 2007). At the same time these types of jobs are increasing, studies indicate that the ethnic make-up of the workforce is rapidly changing (Cole and Espinoza 2008; May and Chubin 2003). In fact, underrepresented groups are estimated to increase from about a quarter of the workforce to almost half by 2050 (Cole and Espinoza 2008; May and Chubin 2003). While the need for STEM workers, particularly engineers, is on the rise, women and minorities also make up an increasing proportion of the labor pool; yet these groups continue to receive proportionally fewer engineering degrees than White men (Anderson et al. 2006; Brown et al. 2005; Cole and Espinoza 2008; French et al. 2005; Johnson 2007; Kissinger et al. 2009; Marra et al. 2012; Tate and Linn 2005). Research focused on attracting and retaining a diverse pop-ulation of students is crucial to the continued development, innovation, growth, and maintenance of STEM-related industries, such as engineering (French et al. 2005; Jiang and Freeman 2011; May and Chubin 2003). Multiple studies indicate that self-confidence and self-efficacy influence college stu-dents' academic achievement (Brown et al. 1989; Hackett et al. 1992; Lent et al. 1986; Pascarella et al. 1987; Santiago and Einarson 1998). Further, numerous studies demon-strate a strong link between student self-confidence and persistence in engineering undergraduate programs (Brainard and Carlin 1998; Burtner 2004; Goodman et al. 2002; Huang and Brainard 2001; Metz et al. 1999; Seymour and Hewitt 1997; Tate and Linn 2005). Research also indicates that strong correlations exist between self-efficacy and persistence (Bandura 1986; Brown et al. 1989; Cordero et al. 2010; Hackett et al. 1992; Lent et al. 1986; Marra et al. 2012; Multon et al. 1991; Pajares 1996; Santiago and Einarson 1998; Schunk 1989; Seymour and Hewitt 1997). A close relationship exists between self-confidence and self-efficacy, whereby self-efficacy informs self-confidence (Schunk 1991). While various studies assess students' self-confidence and/or self-efficacy beliefs and various outcomes associated with these beliefs, much still needs to be under-stood, especially regarding how self-confidence in science, mathematics, and engineering courses (STEM confidence) varies across the intersection of gender and race, in addition to how student experiences influence STEM confidence. Because women and particular minority groups, including African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders, continue to be underrepresented in the engi-neering field, this study seeks to unpack how the undergraduate engineering experiences of these students influence their STEM confidence. Data from the Project to Assess Climate in Engineering (PACE) enables analysis of these underrepresented groups because of the large number of student respondents across multiple schools. The close relationship between self-confidence and self-efficacy points to social cognitive theory as an appro-priate framework for examining: (1) how student STEM confidence levels vary by racial/ ethnic group and gender, and (2) how STEM confidence is affected by personal, envi-ronmental, and behavioral factors. Personal factors include perceptions of the engineering field and major desirability; environmental factors include perceptions of professors, comparisons with other students, and interactions with other students; and behavioral factors include student performance as measured by grade point average (GPA). In order to better understand how these aspects of engineering undergraduate experiences influence and impact student STEM confidence, the article starts by unpacking social cognitive, self-efficacy, and self-concept theories, followed by a review of existing research focused on Res High Educ (2014) 55:810–832 811}

,	abstract	= {Tens of thousands of young people leave school with no or very few qualifications in England. This paper seeks to build a fuller picture of Key Stage 4 low achievement and its correlates than available hitherto. We focus on three aspects. Firstly, the role of students’ personal characteristics, especially gender, ethnicity and past achievement, in explaining the incidence of low achievement at age 16. Secondly, we investigate the extent to which particular personal characteristics constitute direct risk factors for low achievement and the extent to which they lead to low achievement because of their correlation with unobserved school and neighborhood quality, i.e. the role of sorting into schools and neighborhoods of different quality. We suggest a method of calculating school quality (how effective a school is in helping its pupils to avoid low achievement) which is akin to the value-added concept, and examine which specific observed school characteristics predict this measure of ‘school quality’. Thirdly, the paper examines the relationship between school resources – particularly per pupil expenditure – and the avoidance of low achievement, exploiting the panel nature of the National Pupil Database. Going beyond simple discrete choice models, the paper employs school fixed effects regression to reduce endogeneity problems and employs panel data at the student level to analyse school resource effects. A number of interesting findings emerge about the correlates of low achievement and of school quality, and we consider the policy implications of our findings.}

Participants were 210 high-school male and female, Caucasian and Hispanic students who worked at computer-based algebra integrated with pedagogical agents. The results indicated, first, that students preferentially chose a same-gender agent and a same-ethnicity agent. Second, males who chose an agent showed more positive attitudes toward working at the learning environment than did males who were assigned to an agent whereas females who were assigned to an agent showed more positive attitudes than did females who chose an agent. Third, Hispanic students showed more positive attitudes toward working at the learning environment than Caucasians. Fourth, females perceived the agent as significantly more affable than did males; Hispanics perceived the agent as significantly more affable than did Caucasians. Last, learner attributes and choice did not affect learning gains in the agent-based environment; rather, the participants overall significantly increased their performances after the intervention. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

,	abstract	= {Given the financial implications for studying at a higher education institution, students are faced with many decisions both in terms of the topics they wish to study but also the decision of whether to remain at home or move away. The aim of this paper is to compare the experiences of South Asian (Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani) female students to White females, to identify similarities and differences between women from the three Asian groups and also compare changes over time. This paper is focused on the term-time accommodation status of these students i.e. the decision to move away or stay residing in the parental/guardian home during their first year of university. Understanding students’ accommodation choices is important as it can limit the other choices they have to make such as which course to choose and students who are limited to their local institutions can only study what is offered by those particular institutions.

,	abstract	= {This study investigated the effects the demographic variables age, gender, and ethnicity and their interactions had on academic performance in online courses delivered by public two-year colleges in Kentucky. The study controlled for previous academic performance measured by cumulative grade point average (GPA). The study used a random sample (N = 320) of all students who had enrolled in at least one online course delivered by the institutions of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System in the spring 2008 semester. A linear hierarchical multiple regression acting as ANCOVA served as the main analysis, with the order entry as follows: cumulative GPA; independent variables (age, gender, ethnicity); interaction vectors; and product vectors. Final course grade served as the dependent variable. The results of the analysis indicated that only cumulative GPA was a significant predictor, explaining approximately 40% of the variance of the final grade. Although differences in final grades were present among the variables age and ethnicity, these differences disappeared when controlling for cumulative GPA. Significance of the results and recommendations for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]}

,	abstract	= {The use of kits in elementary science classes is a growing trend in some countries. Kits provide materials and inquiry lessons in a ready-to-teach format for teachers to use in their science instruction. This study examined elementary teachers' instructional strategies, classroom practices, and assessment types in relation to the frequency of science kit use. A total of 503 elementary teachers from an urban school district received professional development, implemented kits in their classrooms for a year, and then completed a survey about science kit use and teaching practices. Despite similarities in demographic characteristics (gender, ethnicity, certification/educational level), there were significant differences in teachers' use of inquirybased teaching and assessment practices by kit use. Teachers who reported using kits the most often were significantly more likely to report that their students designed and implemented laboratory investigations as well recorded, represented, and analyzed data. In addition, the high kit users indicated that they were more likely to use student groups, require students to use evidence to support claims, and use alternative assessments of student work including portfolios, notebooks, and long-term projects than those teachers who used kits less frequently. Those teachers who reported using kits the least often were significantly more likely to report having students practice for standardized tests. The role of kits in promoting reform-based teaching practices is discussed. © 2012 Taylor \& Francis.}

,	abstract	= {This study explores students’ self- perceptions across science subjects (biology, chemistry, and physics) by gender and underrepresented minority group membership. The data are drawn from the Persistence Research in Science and Engineering (PRiSE) project, which surveyed 7,505 students (enrolled in college English courses required for all majors) from 40 colleges and universities across the United States about their backgrounds, high school science experiences, and science attitudes. We compared the responses for three focal items on the PRiSE survey that asked students: “Do you see yourself as a biology/chemistry/physics person?” The results indicate that students’ overall self-perceptions toward science are less than ideal. For many students in college, even those pursuing science-related careers, frequencies fell well below the midpoint of the scale. Consistent with other research, females had significantly lower self-perceptions toward physics, and Hispanic females tended to be the most disempowered in their views of themselves with respect to science.}

Much previous research has focused on gender gaps, while overlooking other factors that may play a role, such as ethnicity. This study looks at the gender differences in cognitive assessments at age five across ethnic groups in a sample of English children from the Millennium Cohort Study. While girls generally perform better than boys, general trends mask some differences across ethnic groups. Results show gender gaps at the mean are largest for black and Pakistani and Bangladeshi children and smallest for white children, they are also larger for the teacher-rated assessments than for the survey-administered tests.}

,	title	= {Ethnicity and student identity in schools: An analysis of official and unofficial talk in multiethnic classrooms}
,	abstract	= {The present study shows that power relations in classrooms between Dutch and immigrant students radically shift when students move from academic talk to more open, free talk. Whereas in their interactions with immigrant students, Dutch students are able to represent the more powerful role in the official, academic discourse, they lose this position in the unofficial, nonacademic discourse. These shifts show that ethnic relationships are played out differently in different discursive domains. They also show that academic identities do not exist as such but are specific to certain minority-majority relationships. This study builds upon a tradition of studies that have argued that ethnic minorities construct academic identities depending on the social setting. However, this study shows the instability of these constructions while demonstrating their dependency on specific ethnic interactions and discursive modes. The study is based on the analysis of interaction patterns in multiethnic classrooms in the Netherlands focussing on (a)symmetries in knowledge sharing. An ethnographic approach is combined with quantitative analyses to test group differences. The results are interpreted and discussed in the light of a poststructuralist view on how ethnic minority groups construct academic identities and how these are related to minority-majority relationships.}

,	title	= {Real and imagined barriers to college entry: Perceptions of cost}
,	abstract	= {Patterns of postsecondary attendance in the United States continue to be stratified by socioeconomic background and race/ethnicity. We suggest that inequalities in knowledge of the costs of going to college contribute to persistent patterns of stratification. We hypothesize that disadvantaged parents who believe their child will attend college are less certain of the costs of college attendance than more advantaged parents. As a result, they are less able or willing to provide an estimate of the costs of college attendance, more likely to over-estimate those costs if they do provide an estimate, and more likely to make larger errors in estimation than comparable middle-class or white parents. Using nationally representative data, we find mixed support for these hypotheses. Socioeconomically disadvantaged parents and minority parents are less likely to provide estimates of college tuition and, when they provide estimates, tend to make larger errors. On average, though, parents provide upwardly biased estimates of cost that are uniform across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We discuss implications of these findings for sociological theory and for inequality in postsecondary education. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

This study sought to compare the relative contributions of ethnicity and English proficiency, and to do so in a context where students had not been selected via interviews or some other proxy for language proficiency. Ethnicity, citizenship, and demographic data, as well as academic performance and progress were obtained for three successive cohorts (entering in 2007, 2008 and 2009) into a three-year pharmacy programme, following a common first-year. Complete data was available for all 297 students entering via this path. By the end of the programme, controlling for grades at entry, students from some non-local ethnic backgrounds (p < .001) underperformed local students, as did males (p < .001) and those who had been identified as having low English proficiency in year 1 (p < .01). Males (p < .01) and one non-local ethnic group (p < .01) were also more likely to have to repeat a year of study. Ethnicity was a stronger predictor than English proficiency or acculturation, but English proficiency was still independently and additively predictive. This suggests that targeted support strategies for students with lower English language proficiency are still important, but that cultural differences should not be underestimated.}

Particular attention is paid to differences in perception by student race and socioeconomic status. I find that black female students are perceived as less attentive and more disruptive than their white, Hispanic, and Asian counterparts. Controlling for academic performance and socioeconomic status mitigates the differences in perceptions of attentiveness but not disruptiveness. Further, the perceptions of attentiveness are significantly related to the probability that a teacher recommends a student for honors courses.

,	title	= {Math and Science Attitudes and Achievement at the Intersection of Gender and Ethnicity}
,	abstract	= {Despite gender similarities in math and science achievement, women continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers. Increasingly, researchers are looking to gender differences in STEM attitudes as the root of this disparity. Theoretical support for the importance of STEM attitudes comes from several theories within educational, social, and vocational psychology, including Eccles’ expectancy-value theory, which maintains that education-related choices are shaped by attitudes—namely, expectations of success and task value as well as self-concept. Yet, the studies testing this model generally have not taken into account the intersection of gender and ethnicity. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by describing gender differences in math and science attitudes and achievement among 367 White, African American, Latino/Latina, and Asian American 10th grade students in neighborhood public high schools from a large northeastern city. Male and female adolescents earned similar end-of-year grades in math and science, whereas Asian American students outperformed students from the other ethnic groups in math and science. Self-report data from paper- and-pencil surveys indicate significant gender differences in that male adolescents reported greater math self-concept and expectations of success and female adolescents reported more science value; gender differences did not vary across ethnic groups. Attitudes were strong predictors of achievement, consistent with hypotheses. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine math and science attitudes and achievement at the intersection of gender and ethnicity across four major ethnic groups. We discuss implications for efforts aimed at improving the representation of women in STEM.}

,	abstract	= {Understanding the construction of belonging, and how unbelonging might be troubled, is critical work. For schools in many parts of the world one of the many challenges of globalisation is the task of teaching with, and for, ethnic and cultural diversity. This paper examines the exclusionary practices of teaching that construct ethnic and religious minority students in states of unbelonging. These practices are due, in part, to teachers’ failure to really know their students. Alongside this argument, discourses of belonging in rural schools that speak to possibilities for everyday place-sharing for ethnic and religious minority students are examined. Simple and common moments of mutual recognition and understanding speak to the possibilities for belonging that are opened up in everyday relations of knowing. The implications of these ideas for teachers and teacher education in what is framed as a ‘pedagogy of belonging’ are considered.}

Participants were one hundred thirteen undergraduates enrolled in science courses in large public college in New York.

Multilevel regression analyses on a sample of 10,433 Dutch students, who were followed for 5 years, showed that misaligned aspirations are related to parental education level and ethnicity, and have a small/medium positive effect on student performance. Based on ecology theory, we proposed that misaligned aspirations relate to differences in parent involvement, student achievement motivation, and teacher expectation bias, and that these factors subsequently influence student performance. The findings, however, indicate that this only applies to teacher expectation bias.}

,	abstract	= {There are ethnic group differences in academic achievement among Australian students, with Aboriginal students performing substantially below and Asian students above their peers. One factor that may contribute to these effects is societal stereotypes of Australian Asian and Aboriginal students, which may bias teachers’ evaluations and influence student outcomes. A questionnaire assessing academic expectancies for hypothetical students from different ethnic groups was administered to 55 experienced teachers and 144 training teachers. A measure of self-expectancies and group expectancies was administered to 516 school students. The findings revealed that Asian students were expected to perform better in mathematics and expend greater effort than Aboriginal and Anglo-Australian students. In turn, there were higher expectancies for mathematics performance for Anglo-Australian students compared with Aboriginal students. We discuss the potential implications of these stereotypes for students’ school achievement, particularly the risk that negative implicit stereotypes might result in these students being directed to special education.

Evidence also suggested that the academic risks of some family structure pattern relative to continuously married parents might have been more pronounced for White children.}

A review of previous studies highlights the need for research which looks beyond ‘the deficit model’ to explain the attainment gap. This research used a mixed-methods approach to explore the academic and social experiences of students, as well as lecturers’ views on student achievement, in one UK University. Findings suggest that there are significant differences in motivation and confidence speaking English for different ethnic groups in this study, and a divergence in attendance and study time by gender – both of which may go some way to helping understand the gaps in attainment. In addition, male and BME students tended to overestimate their likelihood of achieving a good degree outcome, compared to other groups.}

,	abstract	= {CONTEXT: Since the 1970s, the UK medical student body has become increasingly diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity and age, but not in socio-economic background. This variance may be linked to large differences in how individual medical schools interpret and put into practice widening participation (WP) policy. However, attempts to theorise what happens when policy enters practice are neglected in medical education. We aimed to explore the dynamics of policy enactment to give a novel perspective on WP practices across UK medical schools. METHODS: We used a qualitative design employing individual telephone interviews to elicit views and concerns around WP from admissions deans and admissions staff within UK medical schools. We carried out interviews with representatives from 24 of 32 UK medical schools. Data coding and analysis were initially inductive, using framework analysis. After the themes emerged, we applied a deductive framework to group themes into four contextual dimensions of 'situation', 'professional', 'material' and 'external'. RESULTS: Our participants held different positions in relation to the interpreting and translating of WP policy, which were influenced by a number of contextual factors including: geographical locality and positioning of the medical school; the expectations of the university and other key stakeholders, and resources. The latter were subtle and referred to resources for medical selection processes rather than for WP per se. The data hinted that the political goal of WP and medical education's goal of producing the best doctors may conflict. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explicitly explore WP policy enactment in medical education. Our analysis is useful for understanding differences in how WP policy is played out in local contexts, and for planning for future policy enactment and research. The messages identified will resonate internationally with all those engaged in efforts to widen participation in medical education.}

,	title	= {Advanced Placement Courses: Gender and Ethnic Differences in Enrollment and Success.}
,	abstract	= {Enrollment in Advanced Placement courses in one Texas school district was examined for two years to determine the extent to which student diversity was present. A higher percentage of girls were enrolled in Advanced Placement courses for both years than was boys. In this urban school district, Whites comprised the largest ethnic group of students enrolled in Advanced Placement courses and African-American students had the lowest percentage of students for both years. Language Arts, Social Studies, and Math were the three areas with the largest percentage of student enrollment for both years, with Foreign Language having the lowest percentage of student enrollment (4.4%) for the most recent year. Boys had higher percentages than girls in Computer Science and Math Advanced Placement courses for both years. Statistically significant differences were present in Advanced Placement subject area enrollment as a function of gender and ethnicity for both years. Regarding student success, White students had the highest percentage of students with exam scores of at least 3, with Black students having the lowest percentage of exam scores of at least 3. Implications of these findings are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]}

,	abstract	= {In this article, we present a mixed-methods study of 2 schools’ elementary science programs including outdoor instruction specific to each school's culture. We explore fifth-grade students in measures of science knowledge, environmental attitudes, and outdoor comfort levels including gender and ethnic differences. We further examine students’ science and outdoor views and activity choices along with those of adults (teachers, parents, and principals). Significant differences were found between pre- and posttest measures along with gender and ethnic differences with respect to students’ science knowledge and environmental attitudes. Interview data exposed limitations of outdoor learning at both schools including standardized test pressures, teachers’ views of science instruction, and desultory connections of alternative learning settings to ‘school' science.}

,	title	= {Agency amidst formidable structures: How girls perform gender in science class}
,	abstract	= {Larger social structures such as race, class, gender, and sexuality and classroom structures like narrowly defined participation practices constrain individuals' agency to engage in untroubled and sustained science identity work. This article explores the central dilemma of attending to structure and agency in settings where inequities are blindingly pronounced. Using a framework that highlights gender as discursive performance, we examine a data set of 13 girls' engagement with school science from fourth to seventh grade (ages 9–13) that shows how structures of gender, race, and class became more salient for girls' trajectories over time. The gender performances that became most pronounced were: minimizing one's differences/fitting in, pleasing adults, and making oneself submissive or invisible. “Helping others” became a subversive, rather than celebrated, practice over time. To illustrate the themes with more depth, we present a longitudinal case study of Mirabel, an academically gifted and scientifically interested first generation immigrant to the US, whose science trajectory became increasingly precarious and entangled with larger social structures. A focus on structures pointed to the narrowly constructed classroom subject positions that left virtually no room to be simultaneously “girly” and “scientific” and the prominence of heteronormative versions of femininity. A focus on agency made evident that girls were less engaged with how to become scientific and more concerned with figuring out what kind of girl to be, given what was acceptable in the setting. We end with an account of Mirabel that highlights her resourcefulness and agency that make possible a hopeful shift in her trajectory. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

,	abstract	= {We examined student characteristics, statistics anxiety and attitudes toward science among 104 (76 females, 23 males, 5 gender not disclosed) undergraduates. Younger students were more negative regarding the implications of science and the enjoyment they perceived in learning science. No significant gender differences were found and Latinos/Hispanics, Caucasian, and other ethnic groups did not differ on statistics anxiety and attitudes toward science. However, anxiety for interpretation of statistics and taking a test and class in statistics were moderately high for these groups. These findings support the notion of the ubiquity of statistics anxiety across groups, regardless of previous experience. We also found that statistics anxiety was inversely related to attitudes toward science, suggesting that future research examine how to improve attitudes toward science to lessen statistics anxiety among students. Limitations of the study are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]}

,	abstract	= {OBJECTIVES Three domains comprise the field of human assessment: ability, motive and personality. Differences in personality and cognitive abilities between generations have been documented, but differences in motive between generations have not been explored. This study explored generational differences in medical students regarding motives using the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). METHODS Four hundred and twenty six students (97% response rate) at one medical school (Generation X = 229, Millennials = 197) who matriculated in 1995 \& 1996 (Generation X) or in 2003 \& 2004 (Millennials) wrote a story after being shown two TAT picture cards. Student stories for each TAT card were scored for different aspects of motives: Achievement, Affiliation, and Power. RESULTS A multiple analysis of variance (p < 0.05) showed significant differences between Millennials' and Generation X-ers' needs for Power on both TAT cards and needs for Achievement and Affiliation on one TAT card. The main effect for gender was significant for both TAT cards regarding Achievement. No main effect for ethnicity was noted. CONCLUSIONS Differences in needs for Achievement, Affiliation and Power exist between Millennial and Generation X medical students. Generation X-ers scored higher on the motive of Power, whereas Millennials scored higher on the motives of Achievement and Affiliation.}

Achievement is equal for different genders but many more males take mathematics forward to advanced levels; social class differences persist in both achievement and participation, and ethnicity shows a varied pattern with some groups performing and participating at particularly high levels and some particularly low. This paper identifies some critical issues that we face in making mathematics and science equitable and begins to analyse some of the barriers that stand in the way of students who are female, and from some ethnic and social groups}

,	abstract	= {This paper is concerned with the experiences of Muslim students attending secondary schools and an elite university in England. The research explores how Muslim young men’s identities are defined by their social and cultural locations. It is argued that identity is multi-dimensional. It intersects and overlaps with several categories of difference including ethnicity, social class, gender, linguistic, cultural and religious affiliations. These exist simultaneously in daily interactions. They are fluid, interconnected, complex and not always easy to disentangle. Ethno- graphy and grounded theory are used to capture the experiences of Muslim young men at a time when educational opportunities and career choices exist alongside disengagement with education and society. For these students the idea of success, though important, is problematic. Real success is tied not just to proven academic ability, but also to finding fulfilment through negotiating a carefully maintained balance between the private and public, secular and religious, individual and community-based expectations. Experiences linked to social class position are fore-grounded. When these intersect with race and grace, a complex picture emerges where young men from Pakistani Muslim background feel that they are both outsiders and insiders in a country where they were born and educated. This exploratory study captures a complex multi-layered world where race is not the only lens through which lived realities can be understood. Exploring the ways in which personal agency and individualism are set against structural inequalities, make it possible to unravel some of the experiences of this under-researched group. The paper looks at how Muslim young men make sense of their experiences and why they feel so strongly that they are not understood.}

,	title	= {Gender Gap Trends on Mathematics Exams Position Girls and Young Women for STEM Careers}
,	abstract	= {Nine years of results on 4.2 million of Indiana's Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress (ISTEP) mathematics (math) exams (grades 3–10) taken after the implementation of No Child Left Behind have been used to determine gender gaps and their associated trends. Sociocultural factors were investigated by comparing math gender gaps and gap trends for (a) state public schools, (b) state nonpublic schools, (c) a low-performing metropolitan school, and (d) a high-performing suburban school. To control for changing sociocultural factors, multiregression analyses were conducted to predict grade-level (3–10) gender gaps and math scale scores using socioeconomic and ethnicity variables. The underrepresentation of females in earning advanced STEM degrees was investigated by determining the gender of the highest performer on the ISTEP math exams in grades 3–10 for each of state's 292 school corporations. Boys' percentages were higher across all grades by about a 2:1 ratio, similar to high-end results on Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) math exams. Simulations of distributions for d = .27 and variance ratio = 1.13 fitted 2013 college-bound SAT math empirical data. Results of the analyses of the state's ISTEP math exam data and the 2013 SAT math scores of college-bound seniors support the arguments that girls and young women possess the abilities to pursue STEM careers that require advanced mathematical skills. The national interest in increasing the number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates that enter the work force is demon-strated by two relatively recent reports. The first report we cite is from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (Olson \& Riordan, 2012) that targets post-secondary STEM education strategies to increase the number of STEM graduates by 1 million students over the next decade. The second report targets primary and sec-ondary schools through a report from the pharmaceutical industry (Battelle Technology Partnership Practice, 2014) that cites current STEM job openings for up to 600,000 unfilled positions and projected STEM job growth by the U.S. Bureau of Labor. Both reports espouse the tenet that all students— particularly the " underrepresented majority " of women and minorities—will benefit from hands-on, inquiry-based learning opportunities and earlier STEM-related recruit-ment strategies. For example, over the past five years members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufac-turers of America have impacted over more than 1.6 million students and 17,500 teachers through grant com-petitions for STEM-related education initiatives. About 85% of their funding has been for K-12 education. The underrepresentation of young women in STEM-related fields and its relationships with mathematics (math) can be documented in numerous ways. One measure of underrepresentation is the annual number of doctorates awarded to females. According to the National Science Foundation's National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (2013), out of nearly 51,000 doc-torates awarded in 2012, 46.2% were awarded to females. In the social sciences, education, and humanities, the per-centages of degrees awarded to females were 58.2, 68.7, and 51.8%, respectively; however, the percentages of females earning doctorates in the life sciences, physical sciences (including math), and engineering were 55.7, 28.5, and 22.4%, respectively. When one does a further breakdown of the physical sciences, one obtains percent-ages of 37.1, 20.6, 41.0, 20.9, and 28.3% for doctoral degrees earned by females in chemistry, computer science, geosciences, physics-astronomy, and math, respectively, during 2012. If one is to improve the career opportunities for females in math, engineering, and the physical sci-ences, the primary and secondary school pipelines for college-bound STEM students are worthy of careful study.}

Statistical analyses suggest the instrument is valid in this setting (with Cronbach alpha above 0.80 for all scales), and data analyses using ANOVA point to relatively few differences between "preferred" and "actual" environments. The research findings suggest all students would prefer a more interactive and equitable classroom, the latter issue of particular importance for one cohort, namely Indo-Fijians (descendents of ethnic Indian indentured labourers). With the exception of this, there are few differences based on ethnicity and further analysis also suggests no differences in perceptions vis-a-vis collaborative versus competitive learning environments, excepting that analysis based on gender shows females have a slight preference for a more cooperative learning environment.

,	abstract	= {The study examines science-related course choices of high-school students in the culturally diverse schools of the province of British Columbia, Canada. The analysis employs K-12 provincial data and includes over 44,000 students born in 1990 who graduated from high school by 2009. The research sample reflects the presence of about 27% of students for whom English is not a first language. We construct an empirical model that examines ethno-linguistic and gender differences in Grade 12 course choices while accounting for personal and situational differences among students. The study employs a course selection typology that emphasizes readiness for science, technology, engineering and math fields of study. Findings indicate that math- and science-related course selection patterns are strongly associated with ethnicity, qualified not only by gender and prior math and science achievement but also by the individual's grade level at entry to the system and enrollment in English as a Second Language program. Students who are more likely to engage in math and science courses belong to Asian ethno-linguistic groups and entered the provincial school system during the senior high-school years. We suggest that ethnic diversity and broader academic exposure may play a crucial role in changing the gender composition of science classrooms, university fields of study and science-related occupations.}

,	abstract	= {Students from state schools are underrepresented in UK medical schools. Discussions often focus on deficient academic and motivational traits of state school students, rather than considering the effects of student support during the admissions process. This qualitative study explored student experiences of support from schools and families during the medical school admissions process with particular focus on the personal statement. Interviews were conducted with thirteen medical students at a British medical school who had each attended a different secondary school (classified as private or state funded). A thematic analysis was performed. Bourdieu's concepts of capital and field were used as a theoretical lens through which to view the results. Interviews revealed substantial differences in support provided by private and state funded schools. Private schools had much more experience in the field of medical school admissions and had a vested interest in providing students with support. State schools were lacking by comparison, offering limited support that was often reactive rather than proactive. Students from private schools were also more likely to have social contacts who were knowledgeable about medical school admissions and who could help them gain access to work experience opportunities that would be recognised as legitimate by selectors. While medical schools endeavour to make fair admissions policies, there is an unintended link between a student's access to capital and ability to demonstrate commitment and motivation on personal statements. This helps explain why academically capable but financially or socially challenged students are less likely to be recognised as having potential during the admissions process. Medical schools need to be challenged to review their admissions policies to ensure that the do not inadvertently favour cultural privilege rather than student potential.}

,	abstract	= {The heightened focus on ‗active‘ citizenship in New Zealand‘s current curriculum (Ministry of Education, 2007) mirrors a pattern observed in many nation‘s curricula in the past decade. The scale of active citizenship in this curriculum includes an expectation that students will participate in local and national communities but also extends to participation in ‗global communities‘. Recognising that citizenship is a hotly contested concept, how do teaching departments, as collective curriculum ‗gatekeepers‘, understand, interpret and enact such curriculum requirements? This paper describes the perceptions and practices toward active citizenship of New Zealand social studies teachers (n=27) from four differing geographic and socio-economic secondary school communities. This study reveals significant differences in the scale of teachers‘citizenship orientations with lower socio-economic school communities prioritising locally-focused citizenship and higher socio-economic communities favouring national and global orientations. Applying a Bourdieusian analysis, the author posits that these diverse perceptions and practices are socially and culturally constituted and reinforced by the shared doxa within school communities. Understanding these differing perceptions of ‗active‘ citizenship is essential to gain more nuanced perspectives on how citizenship education is enacted and practised in classrooms. Keywords:}

Through the lens of identity as performativity and Bourdieu's notions of habitus and capital, the ways in which two girls engage with the field of science is examined. Samantha is British Indian and Fay is British Bangladeshi and they are both ‘top set’ students in science, but only one aspired to study triple science, while the other desired to be ‘famous’. The experiences of the two girls are explicated in this paper, teasing out their experiences and constructions of science.

Twelve qualitative interviews were conducted with 4 faculty members from 3 different types of schools of pharmacy in the United Kingdom: a newer school, an established teaching-based school, and an established research-intensive school. Selection was based on a representation of both science-based and practice-based disciplines, gender balance, and teaching experience. The interview transcripts indicated how these members of the academic community describe knowledge. There was a polarization between science-based and practice-based educators in terms of Bourdieu's description of field, species of capital, and habitus. A Bourdieusian perspective on the differences among faculty member responses supports our understanding of curriculum integration and offers some practical implications for the future development of pharmacy programs.}

In the context of a rereading, from an educational theory perspective, the article proposes an approach that allows for the linking of empirically informed social theory, on the one hand, and biography research oriented to educational theory, on the other. Education, here, is generally conceived of as habitus transformation. For reconstructing the societal conditions of the possibility of education one needs to go beyond the habitus theory and its focus on actors and groups of actors. From the perspective of a theory of practice as proposed by Bourdieu, the concept that comes to mind is that of social field, largely neglected in the theory-of-education discourse.

Informed by an assemblage of Bourdieu's concept of habitus and his sociological theory of practice, Gee's concept of primary Discourses, and Omi and Winant's theory of racial formation, the research questions are as follows: How are the concepts of race, racism, and racialization understood by one teacher?

,	abstract	= {Bourdieu did not write anything explicitly about education policy. Despite this neglect, we agree with van Zanten that his theoretical concepts and methodological approaches can contribute to researching and understanding education policy in the context of globalisation and the economising of it. In applying Bourdieu’s theory and methodology to research in education policy, we focus on developing his work to understand what we call ‘cross-field effects’ and for exploring the emergence of a ‘global education policy field’. These concepts are derived from some of our recent research concerning globalisation and mediatisation of education policy. The paper considers three separate issues. The first deals with Bourdieu’s primary ‘thinking tools’, namely practice, habitus, capitals and fields and their application to policy studies. The second and third sections consider two additions to Bourdieu’s thinking tools, as a way to reconceptualise the functioning of policy if considered as a social field. More specifically, the second section develops an argument around cross-field effects, as a way to group together, research and describe policy effects. The third section develops an argument about an emergent global education policy field, and considers ways that such a field affects national education policy fields.}

,	title	= {Cultural Capital, Gender, and School Success: The Role of Habitus}
,	abstract	= {Studies of the effects of cultural capital on the educational success of male and female students have reached coLtiadictory concusions, and few studies have considered the role that habitus plays in educational outcomes. This article ana-lyzes the cultural participation of eighth-grade boys and girls and presents a model that includes a measure for habitus. Through a detailed analysis of cultur-al practices that have typically been grouped together as a single scale, the author found that female and higher-SES students are more likely to participate in cul-tural activities. In addition, in both standard ordinary least squares and fixed school-effects models, she found that cultural capital has a positive, significant effect on the grades of female students, both with and without controlling for Bourdieu's notion of habitus. For male students, the effect is weaker and present only in the fixed-effects models. Habitus itself has a strong effect for both male and female students in all models. The author argues that traditional gender stereotypes play a role in the lack of cultural participation by male students and that female students may be more encouraged to make use of their cultural cap-ital to succeed in school. ourdieu (1973:80) wrote: By doing away with giving explicitly to everyone what it implicitly demands of everyone, the educational sys-tem demands of everyone alike that they have what it does not give. This consists mainly of linguistic and cultural compe-tence and that relationship of familiarity with culture which can only be produced by family upbringing when it transmits the dominant culture. Bourdieu's theory of social reproduction and cultural capital posits that the culture of the dominant class is transmitted and rewarded by the educational system. To acquire cultural capital, a student must have the ability to receive and internalize it. Although schools require that students have this ability, they do not provide it for them; rather, the acquisition of cultural capital and consequent access to academic rewards depend on the cultural capital passed down by the family, which, in turn, is largely dependent on social class. Cultural capital, then, is comprised of "lin-guistic and cultural competence" and a broad knowledge of culture that belongs to members of the upper classes and is found much less frequently among the lower classes.

,	abstract	= {AbstractDrawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s relational theory this paper shows that many teachers misrecognize the impact of teacher–student relationships on school dropout. The study is based on a series of 60 semi-structured interviews with teachers from Austrian secondary schools. The analysis of the empirical data reveals that many teachers attribute school disengagement and dropout to personal and family factors, whereas the causes of school dropout which are linked to the school structure, attitudes and behaviour remain unspoken or marginalised. The findings illustrate that the interplay between a defensive traditional teaching habitus, a field of traditional teaching and the mainstream doxa legitimises a logic of teaching practice which ignores the importance of social capital to counteract the process of dropping out. It is concluded that traditional habitus–field relations inhibit the building of social capital and relationships in school, which both are crucial resources to tackle school dropout.}

,	title	= {Bourdieu, Department Chairs and the Reform of Science Education}
,	abstract	= {Using the insights of the French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu, this article considers the role of the science department chair in the reform of school science education. Using Bourdieu's 'thinking tools' of 'field', 'habitus' and 'capital', we case study the work of two teachers who both actively pursue the teaching and learning of science as inquiry. One teacher, Dan, has been a department chair since 2000, and has actively encouraged his department to embrace science as inquiry. The other teacher, Leslie, worked for one year in Dan's department before being transferred to another school where science teaching continues to be more traditional. Our work suggests that there are three crucial considerations for chairs seeking to lead the reform of science teaching within their department. The first of these is the development of a reform-minded habitus, as this appears to be foundational to the capital that can be expended in the leadership of reform. The second is an understanding of how to wield power and position in the promotion of reform. The third is the capacity to operate simultaneously and strategically within, and across, two fields; the departmen-tal field and the larger science education field. This involves downplaying administrative logics, and foregrounding more inquiry-focused logics as a vehicle to challenge traditional science-teach-ing dispositions—the latter being typically dominated by concerns about curriculum 'coverage'.}

This article explores the usefulness of these underexamined concepts for studying policy in higher education. It begins by showing how Bourdieu's 'field' approach enables higher education to be examined as a distinct and irreducible object of study. It then explores the value and limitations of this conceptualization through analyses of policy during two contrasting moments of transition in the same field. First, the insights offered by a field approach are illustrated by analysing the new student debate over the creation of new universities in early 1960s English higher education. This shows how the field's relatively high autonomy shaped the focus and form of policy debates by refracting economic and political pressures into specifically educational issues. Second, considering contemporary changes in policy highlights how the erosion of the social compact underpinning higher education has increasingly fractured autonomy, necessi-tating the development of Bourdieu's conceptualization. A distinction between positional and relational dimensions of autonomy is introduced to capture an increasing disjuncture between the origins of the actors running higher education and of the principles they are adopting, respectively. These concepts are utilized to illuminate the effects of current moves towards marketization and managerialism in higher education on principles, practices and identities within the field.}

There is an active debate on the possible causes with primary influences on the student experience which drives the student towards the decision to leave higher education. These influences are articulated through a political and empirical language but are poorly developed within a theoretical framework capable of providing an integrated understanding of the process. Pierre Bourdieu's theory using cultural capital and social reproduction provide a useful and important alternative conceptual framework to the interactionist model developed by Tinto (1993). Bourdieu's theory has had some application in the US (Berger 2000). This paper tentative explores the contribution that Bourdieu's theory has for understanding student retention within the context of UK higher education. It draws on transcripts of student experience of early departure from full time undergraduate study to evaluate this alternative "lens" for interpreting retention.}

Drawing on works by Bourdieu and Bernstein, I present four case studies of students who lived through university committed, alienated or in transition toward either commitment or alienation. I show that despite similar working-class backgrounds, study participants? reaction to university was anything but predictable. Instead, prior socialization, clear and realistic career goals, and chance encounters at university played an important role in their approach to university life.}

Finally, the paper suggests that educational understandings, including some educational research, are predisposed to misrecognise Bourdieusian concepts, and four areas of tension are identified.

,	title	= {It was serendipity: A qualitative study of academic careers in medical education}
,	abstract	= {Context Despite a demand for educational expertise in medical universities, little is known of the roles of medical educators and the sustainability of academic careers in medical education. We examined the experiences and career paths of medical educators from diverse professional backgrounds seeking to establish, maintain and strengthen their careers in medical schools. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 44 lead and early-career medical educators from all 21 Australian and New Zealand medical schools. Questions explored career beginnings, rewards and challenges. Transcripts underwent systematic coding and independent thematic analysis. Final themes were confirmed by iterative review and member checking. Analysis was informed by Bourdieu's concepts of field (a social space for hierarchical interactions), habitus (individual dispositions which influence social interactions) and capital (economic, symbolic, social and cultural forms of power). Results Participants provided diverse accounts of what constitutes the practice of medical education. Serendipitous career entry and little commonality of professional backgrounds and responsibilities suggest an ambiguous habitus with ill-defined career pathways. Within the field of medicine as enacted in medical schools, educators have invisible yet essential roles, experiencing tension between service expectations, a lesser form of capital, and demands for more highly valued forms of scholarship. Participants reported increasing expectations to produce research and obtain postgraduate qualifications to enter and maintain their careers. Unable to draw upon cultural capital accrued from clinical work, non-clinician educators faced additional challenges. To strengthen their position, educators consciously built social capital through essential service relationships, capitalising on times when education takes precedence, such as curriculum renewal and accreditation. Conclusions Bourdieu's theory provides insight into medical educator career paths and the positioning of medical education within medical schools. Medical educators have an indistinct practice, and limited cultural capital in the form of research outputs. In order to maintain and strengthen their careers, educators must create alternative sources of capital, through fostering collaborative alliances. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]}

,	abstract	= {OBJECTIVES: The hidden curriculum may be framed as the culture, beliefs and behaviours of a community that are passed to students outside formal course offerings. Medical careers involve diverse specialties, each with a different culture, yet how medical students negotiate these cultures has not been fully explored. Using surgery as a case study, we aimed to establish, first, whether a specialty-specific hidden curriculum existed for students, and second, how students encountered and negotiated surgical career options. METHODS: Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we explored students' thoughts, beliefs and experiences regarding career decisions and surgery. An exploratory questionnaire informed the discussion schedule for semi-structured individual interviews. Medical students were purposively sampled by year group, gender and career intentions in surgery. Data collection and analysis were iterative: analysis followed each interview and guided the adaptation of our discussion schedule to further our evolving model. RESULTS: Students held a clear sense of a hidden curriculum in surgery. To successfully negotiate a surgical career, students perceived that they must first build networks because careers information flows through relationships. They subsequently enacted what they learned by accruing the accolades ('ticking the boxes') and appropriating the dispositions ('walking the talk') of 'future surgeons'. This allowed them to identify themselves and to be identified by others as 'future surgeons' and to gain access to participation in the surgical world. Participation then enabled further network building and access to careers information in a positive feedback loop. For some, negotiating the hidden curriculum was more difficult, which, for them, rendered a surgical career unattractive or unattainable. CONCLUSIONS: Students perceive a clear surgery-specific hidden curriculum. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we have developed a model of how students encounter, uncover and enact this hidden curriculum to succeed. Drawing on concepts of Bourdieu, we discuss unequal access to the hidden curriculum, which was found to exclude many from the possibility of a surgical career.}

,	abstract	= {European researchers have recently introduced Bourdieu's habitus theory and research methods into the research field of career development. The advantage of Bourdieu's theory is to overcome the theoretical problems that in this field have resulted from over emphasis on individual aspects of career development at the expense of social aspects. The habitus concept allows for the dichotomy between the individual and the social dimensions to be overcome. The research reported here looks at the interplay between habitus, social variables and career preferences but in a younger age group than has previously been studied. It also wonders whether habitus groups exist in the relatively homogenous population of Iceland at a relatively young age, i.e., before divergence in the educational system. Analyses resulted in five habitus groups being formed on the basis of endorsement of cultural and leisure activities. Furthermore, the five groups differed both in terms of sex composition and - importantly - of preferred future occupations. It was concluded that habitus groups form readily and have important implications for research and practice within the field of career counselling.

,	abstract	= {Bourdieu's social theory offers a way of understanding some of the most important features of the field of educational research, while also providing educational researchers with a rich conceptual apparatus for their practice. This article addresses both of these methodological themes and the connections between them. We begin by outlining some key trends in educational research, mainly in Britain, over recent decades in terms of Bourdieu's Field Theory. Special attention is given to the relative positioning of researchers and the formation of an 'avant-garde'. We refer to the impact of educational policy and attacks on educational research, with attendant effects on the field, and on the formation and legitimacy of knowledge about educational processes. This analysis is followed by an example taken from a contemporary research project in which principles derived from Bourdieu's approach have been adopted in framing methodology. We give particular attention to the terms of the programme in which the project forms a part, and key aspects of it such as 'user engagement'. Both methodological justifications and consequences are discussed, as well as tensions with dominant expectations of research processes and outcomes. Finally, we argue that, following Bourdieu's own public strategies of sociopolitical action, educational research methodology that is radically reflexive has the capacity to found a critically effective discourse with practical consequences.}

,	abstract	= {The literature in science education highlights the potentially significant role of outside-school factors such as parents, cultural contexts and role models in students’ formation of science attitudes and aspirations, and their attainment in science classes. In this paper, building on and linking Bourdieu’s key concepts of habitus, cultural and social capital, and field with Sen’s capability approach, we develop a model of students’ science-related capability development. Our model proposes that the role of outside-school factors is twofold, first, in providing an initial set of science-related resources (i.e. habitus, cultural and social capital), and then in conversion of these resources to science-related capabilities. The model also highlights the distinction between science-related functionings (outcomes achieved by individuals) and science-related capabilities (ability to achieve desired functionings), and argues that it is necessary to consider science- related capability development in evaluating the effectiveness of science education. We then test our theoretical model with an account of three Turkish immigrant students’ science-related capabilities and the role of outside-school factors in forming and extending these capabilities. We use student and parent interviews, student questionnaires and in-class observations to provide an analysis of how outside-school factors influence these students’ attitudes, aspirations and attainment in science.}

,	title	= {Gendered habitus and gender differences in academic achievement}
,	abstract	= {Bourdieu’s theory of cultural and social reproduction posits that students’ habitus—learned behavioural and perceptual dispositions rooted in family upbringing—is a formative influence on how they react to their educational environments, affecting academic practices and academic achievement. Although originally conceived as a “class” variant construct, it has been argued subsequently that habitus is also conditioned by gender socialization, and so may also be characterized by significant gender differences. Working with multilevel Canadian data from the linked PISA-YITS surveys, this study investigates gender differences in a Bourdieu derived “structure-disposition-practice” model of academic achievement. For the most part gender differences in the model are modest, but several significant differences are evident: the boys outscore the girls in math and science while the girls excel in reading, students’ socioeconomic stats (SES) has a relatively stronger effect on the girls’ academic achievement than on the boys’ achievement, while students’ habitus affects the boys’ academic achievement more strongly than the girls’ achievement. Finally, the average SES of the schools’ students attend affects both the boys’ and the girls’ academic achievement, but this effect is stronger for the boys, and the effect of the boys’ habitus on their academic achievement diminishes slightly as the average SES of the schools they attend increases; no such contextual interaction was evident for the girls. Overall, the results suggest that habitus and the “structure-disposition-practice” model may still offer a worthwhile contribution to our understanding of gender differences in educational and occupational outcomes, and indeed, merit further empirical investigation. Selon la th\'eorie de Bourdieu sur la reproduction culturelle et sociale, l’habitus des \'el\`eves – leurs dispositions comportementales et perceptuelles apprises et ancr\'ees dans leur \'education familiale – constitue une influence formative sur leur r\'eaction \`a leurs milieux \'educationnels, ce qui affecte leur rendement et leurs pratiques acad\'emiques. Quoiqu’\`a l’origine, l’habitus ait \'et\'e con\ccu comme un concept qui variait en fonction de la classe sociale, on a \'etabli depuis qu’il est \'egalement d\'etermin\'e par la socialisation li\'ee au sexe et qu’il peut donc se caract\'eris\'e par des diff\'erences significatives entre les sexes. Puisant dans des donn\'ees canadiennes \`a plusieurs niveaux provenant de l’Enqu\^ete aupr\`es des jeunes en transition (EJET) et du Programme international pour le suivi des acquis des \'el\`eves (PISA), cette \'etude porte sur les diff\'erences entre les sexes dans un mod\`ele de rendement acad\'emique « structure-disposition-pratique » d\'eriv\'e de Bourdieu. De fa\ccon g\'en\'erale, les diff\'erences entre les sexes sont modestes, mais plusieurs diff\'erences significatives se sont toutefois manifest\'ees : le rendement des gar\ccons en math\'ematiques et en sciences est sup\'erieur \`a celui des filles; les filles excellent en lecture; le statut socio\'economique (SSE) des \'el\`eves a plus d’impact sur le rendement acad\'emique des filles que des gar\ccons; et l’habitus des \'el\`eves affecte davantage le rendement acad\'emique des gar\ccons que celui des filles. Le SSE moyen des \'el\`eves de l’\'ecole affecte le rendement acad\'emique des gar\ccons et des filles, mais l’impact est plus fort chez les gar\ccons. L’effet de l’habitus des gar\ccons sur leur rendement acad\'emique diminue un peu avec l’augmentation du SSE moyen des \'el\`eves de leur \'ecole; cette interaction contextuelle n’a pas \'et\'e not\'ee chez les filles. Globalement, les r\'esultats portent \`a croire que l’habitus et le mod\`ele « structure-disposition-pratique » peuvent continuer \`a enrichir nos connaissances des diff\'erences entre les sexes quant au rendement \'educatif et professionnel et qu’ils m\'eritent \^etre l’objet de d’autres \'etudes empiriques.}

,	abstract	= {In this article we reflect on the increasingly popular concept of career capital, and apply the concept to data generated with a sample of women scientists. We propose that by examining career capital through a 'gendered lens' we can provide insight into structural constraint, often missing in discussions of this concept. Based on the findings from in-depth interviews with 31 women scientists, ranging from post-doctoral researcher to professor, we argue that even within occupational fields the notion of capital must be seen as differentiated, not only in terms of its meaning and expression within these fields, but also in terms of its availability. Thus we suggest that in analyzing careers we should examine deficits and impediments alongside capital, whilst maintaining awareness of social structural constraint. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Yet survey research data consistently show the absence of family background measure effects on high school grades. It is argued that conventional measures of family background fail to capture those cultural elements of status that make a difference in school interactions. Drawing on Weber's work on status groups and status cultures, and on Bourdieu's work on cultural capital, this paper reports the findings of an effort to assess the impact of one component of status culture participation—cultural capital—on one aspect of life chances—students' high school grades. A composite measure of cultural capital has a significant impact on grades, controlling for family background and measured ability. The pattern of relationships, however differs strikingly by gender however, differs strikingly by gender.}

Drawing on qualitative data from four focus groups, 32 interviews, four accompanied visits to ISE institutions, and field notes, this paper presents an analysis of exclusion from science learning opportunities during visits alongside participants' attitudes, expectations, and conclusions about participation in ISE. Participants came from four community groups in central London: a Sierra Leonean group (n = 21), a Latin American group (n = 18), a Somali group (n = 6), and an Asian group (n = 13). Using a theoretical framework based on the work of Bourdieu, the analysis suggests ISE practices were grounded in expectations about visitors' scientific knowledge, language skills, and finances in ways that were problematic for participants and excluded them from science learning opportunities. It is argued that ISE practices reinforced participants preexisting sense that museums and science centers were "not for us." The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings in relation to previous research on participation in ISE and the potential for developing more inclusive informal science learning opportunities.}

The study on which the article draws is located in two institutions: an independent school and a sixth-form college. It follows 12 middle-class young people through their two years of A level study prior to university. The thesis argues for educational decision making as a classed practice, using Bourdieu’s trilogy of habitus, capital and field to develop a more nuanced understanding than that offered by occupationally defined social class. This article focuses on the narratives of three of those students. Drawing on their narratives of transition, the article aims to explore how far the concept of habitus can be used in empirical research. It is concluded that whilst there are limitations to what habitus offers as a research tool, it is a concept worth grappling with. If its promise is partially fulfilled, at the very least it accentuates the inadequacy of defining individuals through the labels of social class. Above all, habitus embraces continuity and change, offering a more fluid and dynamic understanding of classed identities.}

The paper argues for greater attention to agency, and community and familial capital, in conceptualising the resilience of those from less privileged backgrounds. While the recognition of 'voice' is important, a curriculum that acknowledges the context independence of knowledge is essential if these students are not to be further disadvantaged.

,	title	= {Bourdieu's notion of cultural capital and its implications for the science curriculum}
,	abstract	= {This paper argues that Bourdieu's notion of cultural capital has significant value for identifying the “worth” of a science education. His notion of “embodied,” “objectified,” and “institutionalized” cultural capital is used as a theoretical lens to identify both the intrinsic value of scientific knowledge and its extrinsic value for future employment. This analysis suggests that science education misses three opportunities to establish its value to its students and the wider public. First, science education commonly has a poor understanding of the nature of embodied capital that it offers, failing to communicate the cultural achievement that science represents. Second, it fails to see itself as a means of developing the critical dispositions of mind, which are the hallmark of a scientist but also useful to all citizens. Third, given the policy emphasis on educating the next generation of scientists, it fails to exploit the one major element of cultural capital that science education is currently seen to offer by scientists, the public, and its students—that is the value that science qualifications have for future employment. Bourdieu's concept that the primary function of education is to sustain the culture and privilege of the dominant groups in society offers a lens that helps to identify how and why these apparent contradictions exist. Drawing on Bourdieu's ideas, we develop a perspective to critique current practice and identify the possible contributions science education might make to remediating social injustice.}

The article also examines Bourdieu's account of academic qualifications as the dominant source of institutionalised cultural capital, and concludes that it does not adequately account for comparative differences in the social structure of competition and ideological shifts in class (re)production in different national contexts. This analysis is based on an empirical investigation of elite students at Oxford University and Sciences Po in Paris. We investigated how they understand the competition for a livelihood and whether they see themselves as more 'talented' than students from non-elite universities. This investigation revealed important similarities and differences between British and French students that have significant sociological implications for the (re)production and legitimation of educational and labour market inequalities.}

Research has focused on these students' pre-admission perceptions of medicine, rather than on their lived experience as medical students. Such research is necessary to monitor and understand the potential perpetuation of disadvantage within medical schools.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES: This study drew on the theory of Bourdieu to explore FiF students' experiences at one Australian medical school, aiming to identify any barriers faced and inform strategies for equity.\\n\\nMETHODS: Twenty-two FiF students were interviewed about their backgrounds, expectations and experiences of medical school. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Findings illustrate the influence and interaction of Bourdieu's principal forms of capital (social, economic and cultural) in FiF students' experiences.\\n\\nRESULTS: The absence of health professionals within participants' networks (social capital) was experienced as a barrier to connecting with fellow students and accessing placements. Financial concerns were common among interviewees who juggled paid work with study and worried about expenses associated with the medical programme. Finally, participants' 'medical student' status provided access to new forms of cultural capital, a transition that was received with some ambivalence by participants themselves and their existing social networks.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the gaps between the forms of capital valued in medical education and those accessible to FiF students. Admitting more students from diverse backgrounds is only one part of the solution; widening participation strategies need to address challenges for FiF students during medical school and should enable students to retain, rather than subdue, their existing, diverse forms of social and cultural capital. Embracing the diversity sought in admissions is likely to benefit student learning, as well as the communities graduates will serve. Change must ideally go beyond medical programmes to address medical culture itself.}

,	abstract	= {For decades, debates over medical curriculum reform have centred on the role of science in medical education, but the meaning of 'science' in this domain is vague and the persistence of the debate has not been explained. Following Bourdieu, this paper examines struggles over legitimate knowledge and the forms of capital associated with science in contemporary UK medical education. Data are presented from a study of two UK medical schools, one with a traditional, science-oriented curriculum, another with an integrated curriculum. Constructions of legitimate knowledge were explored at both schools through six months participant observation, interviews with faculty members (n=15) and students (n=37) and documentary analysis. Findings show that medical schools compete for both scientific and clinical capital, but ultimately science has greater legitimacy. 'Science' is defined in accordance with the structure of the traditional curriculum and has become a symbolic resource - a mark of distinction for both medical schools and medical students - which is equated with clinical competence. The significance of science is circumscribed by the medical education field, yet the struggles for scientific capital there have ramifications beyond medical education itself. It is argued that Bourdieu's concepts are particularly useful tools for studying the meanings that science takes on outside of the scientific field. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.}

In austerity England, the issue of middle-class social reproduction through higher education increases in saliency, and students’ awareness of how to ‘play the game’ of enhancing their chances to acquire a sought-after graduate position becomes increasingly important. Using data from a longitudinal study of working-class and middle-class undergraduates at Bristol’s two universities (the Paired Peers project), we employ Bourdieu’s conceptual tools to examine processes of capital mobilisation and acquisition by students to enhance future social positioning. We highlight middle-class advantage over privileged access to valued capitals, and argue that the emphasis on competition, both in terms of educational outcomes and the accrual of capital in the lives of working-class and middle-class students, compounds rather than alleviates social inequalities.}

The rationale: the nation with the best schooling producing the most successful pupils has the highest chance of securing future growth and progress for its respective society. In order to gauge and compare schools, we now are equipped with globalised measuring tools that calculate school quality within each nation-state. How is the process manifested within schools, and how do we trace the practices, rationalities and other entanglements from separate interests/fields in contemporary schooling? This article offers an expanded notion of Bourdieu’s concept of field that can assist educational researchers in focusing on a particular educational field using a conceptual tool to trace such practices, rationalities, and entanglements across different fields. Bourdieu’s ideas are interwoven with Foucault’s and his historical gaze, through Foucault’s methodology of archaeology. When examining an institution, practice or any other phenomenon in the educational field, we must ask, “Which will wills it?” and which historical conditions allow a particular phenomenon to exhibit contemporary manifestations. This article proposes a framework using the image of quasi-self-similar fractals to highlight entanglements between multiple semi-autonomous fields. This image of thought is constructed to capture the specific role the economic field plays in relation to all other fields and to consider how every field is thus a power field. To exemplify this argument, empirical data from a Danish regional project will be used to show how the above-mentioned methodological encounter between Bourdieu and Foucault and the concept of field can be applied. Equipped with this framework, the example explores and illuminates 1) a specific scientific habitus fostered within the educational field Homo empiricus; 2) the rationality or discursive formation supporting ‘the Man of Science’; and 3) how the two are related to the ‘empire-building business’ or, in other words, how to market and sell certain aspects of schooling.}

,	abstract	= {Using Bourdieu’s theoretical model as a lens for analysis, we sought to understand how students experience the undergraduate medical education (UME) milieu, focusing on how they navigate transitions from the preclinical phase, to the major clinical year (MCY), and to the preparation for residency phase. Twenty-two medical students participated in this longitudinal case study. Students had similar preclinical and post-MCY experiences but different MCY experiences (rotational vs. longitudinal tracks). We interviewed students every 6 months in the preclinical phase, mid-way through MCY, and 7–8 months before graduation (101 total interviews). We inductively created codes, iteratively revised codes to best-fit the data, and thematically clustered codes into Bourdieuinformed categories: field (social structures), capital (resources) and habitus (dispositions). We found that students acclimated to shifts in the UME field as they moved through medical school: from medical school itself to the health system and back. To successfully navigate transitions, students learned to secure capital as medical knowledge and social connections in the preclinical and preparation for residency phases, and as reputable patient care and being noticed in the clinical phase. To obtain capital, and be wellpositioned for the next phase of training, students consistently relied on dispositions of initiative and flexibility. In summary, students experience the complex context of medical school through a series of transitions. Efforts to improve UME would be well-served by greater awareness of the social structures (field) that students encounter, the resources to which they afford value (capital), and the dispositions which aid acquisition of these resources (habitus).}

,	abstract	= {This paper is an unedited version of a reply to Burke et al's (forthcoming) response to my critique of the notions of 'institutional habitus' and 'family habitus' in the sociology of education. It begins by welcoming the work done by the threesome to distance themselves from some of the clumsier uses of the terms in previous research but then, via a revisiting of the three fatal flaws underscored in the original paper, points out that the processes and themes supposedly spotlighted by the new concepts have already been named and conceived by Bourdieu but much more clearly and coherently. Finally, I contemplate the trio's strategy of positioning themselves and their misapprehension of Bourdieu as a gallant heterodoxy compared to the crude and uncritical orthodoxy that my own efforts supposedly represent.

,	abstract	= {Currently, science in England is distinctive at General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in comparison to most other subjects, in that there is a notable stratification of award routes. The most prestigious of these, 'Triple Science' (the route for entry for three separate science GCSEs), is championed by English government and industry, but has received scant critical academic attention to date. Drawing on data collected via a national survey of over 13,000 Year 11 students aged 15/16 years and in-depth longitudinal interviews conducted with 70 students from this cohort (from age 10 to 16), we discuss how most students have little if any choice over which science 'option' they take at GCSE. Drawing on Bourdieu's concept of pedagogic action, we unpick how students are 'channelled' into making the 'right' choices and come to accept their allocation as legitimate. We explore how selective practices around Triple Science create and perpetuate social inequalities, producing different patterns of student identity, aspiration and attainment. In particular, we discuss the identification of Triple Science as 'for the clever' and problematise its relationship with the science 'pipeline' . We conclude by suggesting potentially more equitable ways forward for science education, reflecting on implications for post-16 participation.}

,	abstract	= {It is widely agreed that there is a need to increase and widen science participation. Informal science learning environments (ISLEs), such as science museums, may provide valuable spaces within which to engage visitors—yet the visitor profile of science museums remains narrow. This paper seeks to understand the experiences of socially disadvantaged families within such spaces. Using a Bourdieusian analytic lens, we analyse qualitative data from a small study conducted with ten parents and ten children from an urban school who visited a large science museum. Data includes pre- and post-interviews, audio recordings and visit fieldnotes. We characterised families’ experiences as falling into three discourses, as ‘disorientating’, ‘fun’ or ‘meaningful’ visits. Analysis identifies how the families’ experiences, and the likelihood of deriving science learning from the visit, were shaped through interactions of habitus and capital. Implications for improving equity and inclusion within ISLEs are discussed.}

,	abstract	= {This paper sets out an argument and approach for moving beyond a primarily arts-based conceptualization of cultural capital, as has been the tendency within Bourdieusian approaches to date.We advance the notion that, in contemporary society, scientific forms of cultural and social capital can command a high symbolic and exchange value. Our previous research [Archer et al. (2014) Journal of Research in Science Teaching 51, 1–30] proposed the concept of ‘‘science capital’’ (science-related forms of cultural and social capital) as a theoretical lens for explaining differential patterns of aspiration and educational participation among young people. Here, we attempt to theoretically, methodologically, and empirically advance a discussion of how we might conceptualize science capital and how this might be translated into a survey tool for use with students. We report on findings from a survey conducted with 3658 secondary school students, aged 11–15 years, in England. Analysis found that science capital was unevenly spread across the student population, with 5% being classified as having ‘‘high’’ science capital and 27% ‘‘low’’ science capital. Analysis shows that levels of science capital (high, medium, or low) are clearly patterned by cultural capital, gender, ethnicity, and set (track) in science. Students with high, medium, or low levels of science capital also seem to have very different post-16 plans (regarding studying or working in science) and different levels of self-efficacy in science. They also vary dramatically in terms of whether they feel others see them as a ‘‘science person.’’ The paper concludes with a discussion of conceptual and methodological issues and implications for practice}

,	abstract	= {There is widespread international concern about post-16 participation rates in science, with women’s under-representation constituting a particular issue. This paper contributes to these debates through a novel, critical examination of the role of masculinity within boys’ negotiations of science aspirations. Drawing on aUKlongitudinal study of children’s science and career aspirations from age 10 to 14 (including a survey of over 9,000 (Year 6, age 10/11) and 5,600 (Year 8, age 12/13) pupils in England and repeat individual interviews with 92 children (at age 10/11) and 85 (age 12/13), the paper focuses in-depth on repeat interviews with 37 boys.We identify five discursive performances of masculinity, which are related to the boys’ (science) aspirations: two are associated with science/related aspirations (termed “young professors” and “cool/footballer scientists”) and three characterize boys who aspire otherwise (“behaving/achieving” boys; “popular masculinity” boys and “laddish” boys). Classed patterns across these five discourses are then explored through two cross-cutting phenomena, (1) popular constructions of science as “brainy”/“smart” and (2) the unevensocial distribution of “science capital,” explaininghoweach of these are implicated facilitating middle-class boys’ identifications from/with science and dissuading working-class boys’ aspirations. We argue that these analyses illuminate an orthodoxy of science careers whichmapsclosely on to current patterns of participation in post-16 science and which impacts powerfully on who can/not conceive of a career in science as being “for me.”}

,	abstract	= {Low participation rates in the study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) post-16 are a matter of international concern. Existing evidence suggests children’s science aspirations are largely formed within the critical 10 to 14 age period. This article reports on survey data from over 9,000 elementary school children in England (age 10/11) and qualitative data from 160 semi-structured interviews (92 children aged 10/11 and 78 parents), collected as part of an ongoing 5-year longitudinal study in the United Kingdom tracking children from 10 to 14. Drawing on the conceptual framework of Bourdieu, the article explores how the interplay of family habitus and capital can make science aspirations more “thinkable” for some (notably middle-class) children than others. It is argued that while family habitus is not deterministic (there is no straightforward alignment between family habitus, capital, and a child’s science aspirations), social inequalities in the distribution of capital and differentially classed family habitus combine to produce uneven (classed, racialized) patterns in children’s science aspirations and potential future participation.}

,	abstract	= {In this study, we examined how a teacher may make a difference to the way interest develops in a science classroom, especially for students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. We adopted a methodology based on the concept of taste for science drawing on the work of John Dewey and Pierre Bourdieu. We investigated through transcripts from video recordings how such a taste is socially constituted in a 9th grade (ages 15--16) science classroom, where there was evidence that the teacher was making a positive difference to students' post-compulsory school choice with regard to science. Salient findings regarding how this teacher supported students' interest are summarized. For example, the teacher consistently followed up how the students acknowledged and enjoyed purposes, norms, and values of the science practice and so ensuing that they could participate successfully. During these instances, feelings and personal contributions of the students were also acknowledged and made continuous with the scientific practice. The results were compared with earlier research, implications are discussed, and some suggestions are given about how these can be used by teachers in order to support student interest.}

Informed by Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction, we focus on three key stages—senior secondary school, the transition to post-secondary studies, and the post-secondary completion stage—to determine whether and how the interrelationships of gender, cultural capital, course completion in senior secondary school, timing of decisions, and initial participation in post-secondary education lead to the completion of science-related undergraduate degrees. Through correspondence analyses of 10 years of longitudinal data with 1,055 respondents, we extend the findings of cross-sectional studies that examine only one aspect of this longitudinal story by showing how the intersection between organisational structures (institutional and disciplinary) and cultural capital transmitted by the family shapes the opportunity structures of access to scientific fields of study by young women and men.
